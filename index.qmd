title: "Catch Them All: The Study of TE Stage 4 MRT Stations' Catchment Areas"

# Introduction

This website provides an overview of our assessment of the accessibility and catchment areas of the Stage 4 Thomson-East Coast line MRT stations.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Background

Thomson East Coast line (TEL) was announced by the [Land Transport Authority](https://www.lta.gov.sg/content/ltagov/en/upcoming_projects/rail_expansion/thomson_east_coast_line.html) on 15 August 2014. It hopes to better serve communities living in the North-South corridor and the East by cutting down travel times to the Central area from 55min to 35min.

This is in conjunction with [Singapore's Green Plan](https://www.greenplan.gov.sg/) which, among others, aims to significantly reduce our carbon emissions and ensure that Singapore is more sustainable. One way would be to reduce demand for private transportation.

Stage 1 (from [Woodlands North to Woodlands South](https://www.lta.gov.sg/content/ltagov/en/newsroom/2019/12/1/public_preview_of_thomson-east_coast_line1_stations_on_11january.html)) opened on 31 January 2020. Stage 2 (from [Springleaf to Caldecott](https://www.lta.gov.sg/content/ltagov/en/newsroom/2019/12/1/public_preview_of_thomson-east_coast_line1_stations_on_11january.html)) opened on 28 August 2021. Stage 3 (from Stevens to Gardens by the Bay), is [opening on 13 November 2022](https://www.lta.gov.sg/content/ltagov/en/newsroom/2022/10/news-releases/thomson---east-coast-line-stage-3-to-open-for-passenger-service-.html).

Our focus is on the Stage 4 stations (Founders Memorial to Bayshore) , which are currently in the works and [will be opened by 2024](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/thomson-east-coast-line-open-november-mrt-free-rides-11-stations-2994101#:~:text=Stage%204%2C%20which%20comprises%20eight,expected%20to%20open%20in%202024.).

## Problem and Aim

[Presently, however, private transportation is preferred due to its ease and comfort.](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/car-sale-coe-prices-premiums-driving-covid-19-pandemic-2295731) As a result, this study aims to see how accessible and convenient TEL Stage 4 MRT stations are for first and last mile journeys. We will do so by analysing two ways in which Singaporeans may get to the MRT -- walking or cycling. This will prove whether the construction of TEL Stage 4 MRT is competent to successfully encourage people to use public transportation.

## Motivation

With [Singapore Green Plan 2030](https://www.greenplan.gov.sg/key-focus-areas/energy-reset/), we want to explore how the expansion of TEL Stage 4 MRT Stations can help in making public transportation and Singapore more sustainable and greener.

## Deliverables

### Deliverable 1

We will provide both the buffer regions and the ISO-areas (using QNEAT3) of the aforementioned stations. The maximum walking distance for both buffer and ISO-area is 1000m while maximum cycling distance is 1500m.

### Deliverable 2

Afterwards, we will be conducting an analysis of the various amenities and buildings that lie within the catchment area.

### Deliverable 3

We will also calculating the number of people who can be potentially served by the MRT stations from each subzone.
