## 1 Means of Analysis

### 1.1. Significance of Catchment Population Distribution (Walking) Analysis

As Singapore moves towards SG Green Plan 2030, one of their goals is to [achieve 75% mass public transport (i.e. rail and bus) peak-period modal share](https://www.greenplan.gov.sg/targets). By expanding current MRT station network, they hope to make public transportation more accessible for Singaporeans to encourage more Singaporeans to take them. With this goal in mind, we will conduct Population Distribution Analysis for Walking Catchment Areas. It will consist of the following:

1.  Proportion of population captured within a subzoneÂ 

2.  Proportion of subzone population who is willing to walk to TEL Stage 4 MRT Stations.

Firstly, our purpose of analysis is to explore explore how effective are the walking catchment areas in capturing subzone population for each TEL Stage 4 MRT Stations based on the current road network present.

Additionally, it is [important to analyze the proportion of Singaporeans who is wiling to walk at each contour distance](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/245561443_Using_Equivalent_Walking_Distance_to_Assess_Pedestrian_Accessibility_to_Transit_Stations_in_Singapore) to evaluate the location chosen for the TEL Stage 4 MRT Stations.

Assumptions made are:

1.  Population is evenly distributed throughout the entire subzone

2.  Results from the study still hold true for all Singaporeans

We have also defined the variables that we will be using in our calculations later and its formula (if any) based on the table as shown below.

### 1.2 Significance of Catchment Population Distribution (cycling) Analysis

With this goal in mind, we will conduct Population Distribution Analysis for Cycling Catchment Areas. It will consist of the following:

1.  Proportion of population captured within a subzoneÂ 

2.  Accessibility of TEL Stage 4 MRT Stations

Firstly, our purpose of analysis is to explore how effective are the cycling catchment areas in capturing subzone population for each TEL Stage 4 MRT Stations based on the current road network present.

However, based on URA,[it is stated that only 3.9% of Singaporeans take a combination of transportation.](https://www.singstat.gov.sg/-/media/files/visualising_data/infographics/c2020/c2020-geographical-distribution-transport.ashx) For example, one combination would be cycling and taking the bus. Therefore, the proportion of Singapore who cycles and takes the MRT is far lesser than the 3.9% stated. Due to low and insignificant numbers, a more suitable analysis to evaluate its location suitability would be from the various subzones that fall within 1.6km radius instead of the number of people who is willing to cycle within the catchment area.Â 

The Singapore Government only built [800 bicycle racks within the 1.5km radius of each MRT Station](https://www.ura.gov.sg/Corporate/Guidelines/-/media/BD725DB201DB496A93569C8072DD9FD0.ashx). However, since our interval between each contour is 200m for contour generation in our QGIS, the max contour will be at 1.6km instead. We will also eliminate subzones from the list of accessibility if the proportion of the subzone that is in the catchment area is below 5% as it renders the subzone insignificant in the catchment area.

Assumption made is:

1.  Population is evenly distributed throughout the entire subzone

We have also defined the variables that we will be using in our calculations later and its formula (if any) based on the table as shown below.

## 2 TE22A Founders Memorial

### 2.1 Catchment Population Distribution (Walking)

![](images/paste-4C323744.png){fig-align="center"}

Based on the Walking Catchment Population Distribution for TE22A Founders Memorial, we can see that these following subzones (Marina East and Tanjong Rhu) are captured at the 1000m mark. However, we can see that the largest proportion of catchment population falls within Tanjong Rhu. This is shown by the blue contour layers.

We further broke down the population distribution per contour and subzone level below to visualize these numbers more clearly. Additionally, we will be multiplying these numbers at every contour level by a ratio (as mentioned earlier) to accurately reflect how many people who are willing to walk to TE22A Founders Memorial (shown below).Â 

Based on the numbers generated, the following breakdown are the Singaporeans who are willing to walk to TE22A Founders Memorial based on each contour interval:

1.  0 Singaporeans within 200m contour

2.  0 Singaporeans within 200-400m contour

### 2.2 Catchment Population Distribution (Cycling)

![](images/paste-9AD79646.png){fig-align="center"}

Based on the Cycling Catchment Population Distribution for TE22A Founders Memorial, we can see that the largest proportion of the catchment population falls within Tanjong Rhu. This is shown by the red contour layers. However, the largest subzone covered in this catchment area is Marina East. This is shown by the white contours covering almost Marina East fully.Â 

We further broke down the population distribution per contour and subzone level below to visualize these numbers more clearly. Though these numbers are very large, the percentage of people who cycle is very low. As a result, these numbers do not reflect people who are willing to cycle to MRT but the distribution of catchment population within subzone areas.

Based on the layout and numbers generated, these following subzones \[Marina East (86.5%), Marina South (9.7%), Nicoll (8.1%), Marina Centre (16.5%), Marina East (MP) (2.2%) and Tanjong Rhu (20.2%)\] are captured at the 1600m mark. Additionally, it is noted that:

1.  Marina South (9.7%) that is within the catchment area, covers water bodies mainly.

2.  Despite 8% of Nicoll falling within the catchment area, this proportion of land coverage is even smaller if we want to eliminate the proportion of Nicoll that is made up of water bodies in the catchment area.

3.  2.2% of Marina East (MP) falls within the cycling catchment area.

As a result, these three subzones are considered insignificant, thus we will eliminate them from the list of subzones.

Therefore, TE22A Founders Memorial is accessible from multiple subzones by cycling:

1.  Marina East (86.5%)

2.  Tanjong Rhu (20.2%)

3.  Marina Centre (16.5%)
