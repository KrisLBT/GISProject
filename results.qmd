## Methodology

For the analysis, both the buffer area (calculated by a given Euclidean distance), the ISO-area (derived from the road network) and the various amenities and buildings that lie within them will be used to assess the accessibility of the stations. A distance of 1000m will be used for walking buffer and ISO-area while a distance of 1500m will be used for cycling. For both cycling and walking ISO-areas, intervals of 200m will be used to determine the relative accessibility of certain amenities within a given catchment area.

## Catchment and Buffer Area Analysis

### TE22A -- Founders Memorial

:::

Notably, there are few residential areas within the walking catchment area. The residential areas are also within the 800-1000m contour, where only a small number of people would be willing to walk. However, this MRT station is near several tourist attractions such as Founder's Memorial and Garden by the Bay East. In doing so, people who wish to visit these areas will have their needs better accommodated to and businesses that cater to them may see increased foot traffic. Hence, tourists and tourist-facing businesses are the main beneficiaries of this station. 

The buffer area covers the area across the bridge while the catchment area that is based on the road network cuts off before the bridge. This suggests that there is the potential for encouraging walks across the bridge that has not yet been fully tapped into yet. To do so, more direct networks could be built such that travellers would be able to cross the bridge without having to use other forms of transport such as buses or taxis.

:::

For the cycling catchment area, more residential areas are covered within it. This could encourage residents to cycle to the MRT instead of driving to their destination. Hence, this could reduce demand for private forms of transportation and encourage them to cycle to the nearby MRT stations.

Furthermore, Promenade MRT (CC4/DT14) lies within the cycling catchment area. This means that line transfers for cyclists who need to travel to a station in the Thomson-East Coast line can do so easily without having to take the bus or private transport.

This will significantly improve first and last mile journeys using public transport for those who are willing to cycle since the reach of TE22A has expanded to those that start or end their journey anywhere along the Thomson-East Coast line or the Circle line.

### TE23 -- Tanjong Rhu

![Buffer](images/TE23%20Walking%20Buffer.png){fig-align="center" width="600"}
:::

Compared to Founder's Memorial, the buffer area and the catchment areas are very similar to each other. This means that this area is very well-connected by the roads and walk/cycleways within the area and no new pathways need to be built to accommodate easier transit

There are more buildings covered by Tanjong Rhu catchment area as compared to Founder's Memorial catchment area. However, some of which lie in both catchment areas. These buildings in the overlapping catchment areas include residential and commercial buildings. Therefore, residents and people who frequent these commercial buildings get to benefit from the convenience of having two accessible MRT stations.

Upon looking at the area on Google Street Maps, some buildings may also be hotels. Building an MRT station in the catchment area would ensure that Singaporeans and tourists staying within this area will be better served by public transportation, especially since there are no nearby other MRT stations within this area, apart from Founder's Memorial.

Sports Hub also lies within the 1000m buffer zone. While it may be a 1000m walk from TE23, people who visit the Sports Hub are most likely to be ready to engage in some form of exercise. Hence, the willingness to walk 1000m to their destination will likely be greater than 15%. Thus, TE23 will serve as a sustainable and motivational form of transportation for active citizens travelling to the Sports Hub. Hence, Singapore residents who wish to exercise will be able to use public transportation to travel there.

:::

In the cycling catchment area, more amenities are covered. The map shows more types of services that Singaporeans can access at the convenience of cycling. Within this area, a school - specifically Dunman High - is accessible within a 1500m distance of the MRT stations. This enables more efficient travel for the students attending that school and eases traffic in the area during school drop-off and pick-up.

This area also now extends to the Paddock Club F1 area through the Benjamin Sheares Bridge, similar to TE22A.

### TE24 -- Katong Park

::: {layout-ncol="2"}

![Buffer](images/TE24%20Walking%20Buffer.png){fig-align="center" width="600"}
:::

For the walking catchment area, it covers a significant number of residential areas for both low rise and high rise buildings, including hotels. The station will, thus, be able to cater to a large and diverse set of people who may need to travel to tourist attractions or to commercial buildings. Since the station aims to reduce travel time to the central area, both tourists and workers will be better accommodated.

Dunman High is also 400-600m away (5-7 minutes' walk) from TE24, making it more convenient for students to alight here than at Mountbatten, the current nearest MRT which is a 15 minutes' walk.

![Buffer](images/TE24%20Cycling.png){fig-align="center" width="600"}
:::

For the cycling catchment area, more amenities are covered and other schools - Tanjong Katong Girl's School and Tanjong Katong Secondary School - also lie within this area. Should students opt for cycling, this station has the potential to ease traffic during drop-off and pick-up periods, which will likely be similar across all levels, especially in primary school.

A large number of low rise residential areas are also covered within this region. This could mean that a significant number of people will no longer need to use their cars to get to different areas of Singapore.

### TE25 -- Tanjong Katong

::: {layout-ncol="2"}

![Buffer](images/TE25%20Walking%20Buffer-02.png){fig-align="center" width="600"}
:::

While there is a discrepancy between the buffer area and the area covered by the network, the difference is mostly in the water, suggesting that this area is well connected by the roads and other networks.

The walking catchment area covers a significant number of residential areas - both high rise and low rise, including hotels and condominiums. This could suggest that the MRT line would need to be able to accommodate a diverse pool of needs, ranging from tourists and workers alike. Importantly, the majority of them are low rise residential areas, where people are generally car owners. Making public transport more accessible to these residents could incentivise them to use their cars less frequently and opt to use the train when travelling.

A large number of amenities lie within this area, such as cafes and shops.  Building an MRT station in this area could boost business due to increased footfall and more efficient travel.

![Buffer](images/TE25%20Cycling%20Buffer.png){fig-align="center" width="600"}
:::

For the cycling catchment area, even more amenities are covered. The map shows more types of services that Singaporeans can access at the convenience of cycling. We can easily see that most buildings, which are mainly residential, lie within the range of 1600m.

Cyclists will be able to visit various amenities throughout this region, which could boost interest in smaller businesses within this area. Furthermore, several schools lie within this catchment area. In doing so, families beyond only the Tanjong Katong region will be served and students will have alternative means to go to school. This could reduce traffic in the region, particularly during drop-off and pick-up periods.\

### TE26 -- Marine Parade

::: {layout-ncol="2"}
![Catchment Area](images/TE26%20Marine%20Parade%20MRT%20(Walkways)%20Updated.png){width="600"}

![Buffer](images/TE26%20Marine%20Parade%20MRT%20(Walking)-01.png){width="600"}
:::

TE26 will have 6 exits that are distributed throughout a relatively large area, where 3 of them lie outside the MRT station itself. The MRT will be located directly beside a few large retail buildings, with one of its exits lying inside one retail building to provide easy access to the station through the mall. This suggests that the intended main beneficiaries of such a station would be people who work in the commercial buildings within the region.

Despite this, within the 0-400m contour of the Iso-Area, it is mostly residential and retail buildings. This shows that the MRT station will be useful in encouraging a diverse set of people to take public transportation as it can reach out to a large number of people who have a high willingness to walk to an MRT station to travel.

::: {layout-ncol="2"}

![Buffer](images/TE26%20Marine%20Parade%20MRT%20(Cycling).png){width="600"}
:::

For the cycling ISO-area, we see that there are mostly more residential and low rise residentials covered by approximately 500 and 1500 respectively, suggesting that people who can cycle to this MRT station are mostly residents as well. Of particular interest is the high number of low rise residentials - many of whom are car owners. This could encourage them to switch away from driving and to more sustainable forms of transport.

Since TE26 reaches approximately 4300 residential, low rise residential and commercial buildings, the largest out of all the other stage 4 TEL MRT stations, the presence of 6 exits to provide greater convenience is justifiable.

### TE27 -- Marine Terrace

::: {layout-ncol="2"}
![Catchment Area](images/TE27%20Marine%20Terrance%20MRT%20(Walkways)%20Updated.png){width="600"}

![Buffer](images/TE27%20Marine%20Terrance%20MRT%20(Walking).png){width="600"}
:::

The contours cover relatively the same areas as the buffer zones, suggesting that the road network in this catchment area is near ideal.

TE27 will have 6 exits distributed evenly on both sides of Marine Parade road and will be located within 0-400m of 5 institutions. This MRT will hence provide students more options and convenience to travel. It could also substantially reduce traffic congestion, especially during drop-off periods, as students may opt to use the MRT instead of private vehicles.

Additionally, many residential and low rise residential buildings are located within 0-600m of the MRT station, meaning that there will be a high percentage of people who will walk to the MRT despite a 50% willingness at a distance of 600m.

::: {layout-ncol="2"}

![Buffer](images/TE27%20Marine%20Terrance%20MRT%20(Cycling).png){width="600"}
:::

Further away, the Iso-Area reaches more low rise residential buildings. In addition to people living within 1km of TE27, those who are willing to cycle to the MRT station will include those that stay in landed properties.

With many amenities that are of high importance and have large density usage, this shows that TE27 will be a very useful station for people to easily access public transportation, hence encouraging more use of public transportation.\

### TE28 -- Siglap

::: {layout-ncol="2"}
![Catchment Area](images/TE28%20Siglap%20MRT%20(Walkways)%20Updated.png){width="600"}

![Buffer](images/TE28%20Siglap%20MRT%20(Walking).png){width="600"}
:::

Most of the buildings within the walking ISO-area of TE28 are low rise residential, suggesting that most people living in this area are of high economic status. As such, most may own private vehicles and the presence of an MRT may not be as effective to encourage people to use public transportation as their form of travel. However, it still has the potential to encourage them to switch over to public transportation occasionally and its presence can precipitate a modal shift within this population.

There are also residential buildings within 0-400m of the MRT and this MRT may greatly serve these residents. Additionally, Victoria School is located within 200m of the MRT, providing great convenience for these students as well.

::: {layout-ncol="2"}

![Buffer](images/TE28%20Siglap%20MRT%20(Cycling).png){width="600"}
:::

With a larger Iso-Area, the catchment area reaches other forms of building types such as warehouses in the North of this catchment area. Hence, workers may benefit from this MRT as they are able to easily travel to work by cycling from the MRT since it is a manageable distance from the MRT station.

Comparing the buffers to the contours for both Cycling and Walking, the contours cover almost the entire area of the buffers, suggesting that the road network is very near ideal as the distance from a building or POI to the MRT station is equally distant at every interval level.

### TE29 -- Bayshore

::: {layout-ncol="2"}
![Catchment Area](images/TE29%20Bayshore%20MRT%20(Walkways)%20Updated.png){width="600"}

![Buffer](images/TE29%20Bayshore%20MRT%20(Walking)-01.png){width="600"}
:::

All types of residential buildings lie close on the north and west sides of TE29. Interestingly, an equal number of residential and low rise residential buildings fall within 0-600m of the catchment area. However, there are no buildings or points of interest that are near these two exits as well. This suggests that the main intended beneficiaries of this station would be residents of all socioeconomic classes but not businesses or tourists. The inclusion of the higher socioeconomic classes means that the wealthier residents may be encouraged to use private transport less and instead use public transport.

![Buffer](images/TE29%20Bayshore%20MRT%20(Cycling).png){width="600"}
:::

For the cycling catchment area, more amenities are covered. The map shows more types of services that Singaporeans can access at the convenience of cycling. More housing estates, as well as schools can be reached. These institutions lie within 1-1.2km of the MRT, a less than 10 minutes cycle. Hence, this convenience may encourage students to cycle to school from the MRT.

### Conclusion

The catchment areas, for both walking and cycling, show us that the main beneficiaries of  the TEL Stage 4 MRT stations are the residents. This is primarily due to the large catering of land use by the [Master Plan 2019](https://www.ura.gov.sg/maps/?service=MP) toward Residential along the East Coast of Singapore in the Marine Parade Subzone. These Residential land use will hence have the greatest direct impact by the presence of TEL. With the majority of these residential buildings being low rise residential estates, the TEL may achieve its goal of encouraging more people to switch to more sustainable forms of transportation as residents will have high convenience and accessibility levels to use public transport to travel to the city centre (as compared to now where they are left with little choice but to use their private vehicles). Since walking or cycling to these MRT stations is very convenient for these residents, and using public transportation to get to the city centre is much more affordable than using taxis or paying city centre parking fees, a majority of these residents will definitely switch to using TEL for the journeys. This will improve road congestion problems
