For our analysis, we used QNEAT3 to find the ISO-area from the various station exits within distances of 1000m and 1500m through the road network. We subsequently used the buffer region using the Euclidean distance of the same values. We then also found the potential population served by the stations. Assuming the population is spread out equally, we used ratio of the subzone area covered by the ISO-area to the total subzone area as a proxy for population percentage served by train station.

The following is a step-by-step guide in using QGIS to complete our task.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 1. Installing QNEAT3 plugin.

Before getting started, you need to install QNEAT3 plugin.

-   From the menu bar, select Plugins -\> Manage and Install plugins

Plugins dialog window appears.

-   At the query, type **QNEAT3**.

Notice that QNEAT3 appears on the search output list.

-   Click on **QNEAT3**.

-   Click on **Install Plugin** button.

When the installation is completed, close the dialog box by

-   click on **Close** button.

In order to activate the Iso-Area as Polygon/Contour algorithms you have to add the **matplotlib** library to your QGIS-Python installation. Depending on your operating system you may install matplotlib manually using the following options:

### 1.1. Windows:

Open the OSGeo4W shell that has been installed alongside QGIS.

-   Click **Start** then type ***OSGeo4W Shell***, and hit **Enter** key.

-   At the **OSGeo4W Shell**, type the command below.

| python-qgis -m pip install matplotlib

-   Press **Enter** key.

-   When the installation is completed, restart QGIS3

### 1.2. macOS

-   Open a terminal.

-   Type the following command:

| /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.x/bin/pip3.x install matplotlib

Note: Replace the version number x according to your installation) into the terminal,

-   Press **Enter** and confirm installation with *yes* when prompted

-   Restart QGIS3

After this installation, you are ready to use all QNEAT3 Algorithms.

Before using the plugin, you must at least read the concept and methods of [Iso-area](https://root676.github.io/IsoAreaAlgs.html) because it will be used in this hands-on exercise.

## 2. Start a new QGIS Project

-   Click **OK**

-   Your screen should look similar to the screenshot below:

    ![](images/paste-4717B379.png)

### 3.3 Extracting TE Stage 4 MRT Stations Exits

However, TEL Stage 4 MRT Station Exits Layer is not currently available on any official websites. As a result, we are not able to download but can only extract out the exits with reference to the MRT layout pictures on [LTA website](https://www.lta.gov.sg/content/ltagov/en/upcoming_projects/rail_expansion/thomson_east_coast_line.html).

#### 3.3.1 Importing OSM and Opening LTA MRT Website

We will be guiding you through the extraction of TE22A Founders Memorial Exits as an example. Each MRT should have one layer with all its respective exits. Therefore, we need to create 7 more vector point layers on top of TE22A Founders Memorial Exits layer

-   Import OSM layer from **Browser**. You will need to refer to the LTA Website as you pick the exit points out. Your screen should look similar to the screenshot as shown below.

    ![](images/paste-6CD3F614.png)

-   Click the LTA Website Link as given above and scroll down till you find TE22A Founders Memorial under Location of Stations. Your screen should look similar to the screenshot as shown below:

    ![](images/paste-3BAE5613.png)

#### 3.3.2 Creating a New Layer for TE22A Founder's Memorial Exits

-   Under **Layers** at the top menu bar, hover your cursor over **Create Layers** and click on **New Shapefile Layer**.

    ![](images/paste-D292441E.png)

Your screen should similar to the screenshot below:

![](images/paste-CA52B5A4.png){fig-align="center" width="300"}

Fill n the specific information as shown in the screenshot below:

![](images/paste-3134789E.png){fig-align="center" width="300"}

-   Under the **Fields List,** click on id and delete it by clicking ![](images/paste-D24000A5.png){width="80" height="20"}

![](images/paste-05C1D015.png){fig-align="center" width="300"}

-   Now, we will start naming our attributes. Once every attribute is filled up, we can click on ![](images/paste-A41F8C08.png){width="80"} to create the field. We need the following attributes:

    1.  Fid (Type: Integer, Length: 10)

        ![](images/paste-CF5ED0FB.png){width="300"}

    2.  MRT line (Type: String, Length: 30)

        ![](images/paste-B29E85EC.png){width="300"}

    3.  Exit (Type: String, Length: 30)

        ![](images/paste-8643F463.png){width="300"}

After creating all 3 variables, your screen should look similar to the screenshot below:

![](images/paste-F59E5832.png){fig-align="center" width="300"}

-   Once you click on **OK**, you can see that TE22A Founder Memorial Exits is added to your layer Menu as a Layer as shown below:

![](images/paste-7C017547.png){fig-align="center" width="300"}

-   If you open your attribute table for TE22A Founders Memorial Exits, you will realize that the **Attribute Table** is empty. Your screen should look like the screenshot as shown below. We will be adding the exit points manually in the next section.

![](images/paste-3F7B5742.png){fig-align="center" width="300"}

#### 3.3.3 Adding Exit Points into Founders Memorial Exit Layer

-   Open the Attribute Table of TE22A Founders Memorial Exits by right-clicking it in the layer menu

![](images/paste-BA0B0BD5.png){fig-align="center" width="300"}

-   Click on ![](images/paste-B0333C09.png){width="16"} so that editing mode can be turned on so that we can start adding the exit points in.

-   Once you exit the **Attribute Table**, click on ![](images/paste-7282DAE8.png){width="16" height="16"}in the top menu and start marking the exit points out with reference to the TE22A Founders Memorial Layout from the LTA Website.

    -   Try to refer to the geographical features (eg. Roads and streets) from both the OSM layer that we previously imported, and image from the LTA website to get as accurate of an exit point as possible. For each exit points selected, fid will be in numerical order and Exits will be in alphabetical order

![](images/paste-950EA1AE.png){fig-align="center" width="300"}

-   Once both exits of TE22A Founders Memorial MRT Station has been marked out, click on **Toggle Editing**

![](images/paste-33D5DBA1.png){fig-align="center" width="300"}

-   Save the changes made by clicking **Save**

![](images/paste-1E4FE4DA.png){fig-align="center" width="300"}

-   Your screen should similar to the screenshot shown below

![](images/paste-EF0DACB4.png){fig-align="center"}

-   Let's compare this to the TE22A Founders Memorial Exits from the LTA website:

![](images/paste-839A7054.png){fig-align="center" width="600"}

-   Let's compare this to the TE22A Founders Memorial Exits from the LTA website

|            Our GIS             |          LTA Website           |
|:------------------------------:|:------------------------------:|
| ![](images/paste-102E8091.png) | ![](images/paste-50DD2DB9.png) |

-   You can see that the points are quite similar in both images but just bear in mind that these points that you have plotted will not be accurate to that of LTA website and my screenshots due to human error. However, you do not have to worry because the results will just vary slightly.

-   Now when you open your **Attribute Table** for TE22A Founders Memorial Exits, you can see that there will be 2 rows of data, reflecting the two exits for the MRT Station. Your screen should look similar to the screenshot as shown below

![](images/paste-F2C999BE.png){fig-align="center" width="300"}

::: callout-note
## DIY

Using the steps you had learned in previous hands-on exercise, save this layer into your GeoPackage as TE22A Founders Memorial MRT Exits
:::

#### 3.3.4. Explain Outliers for TE26 Marine Parade

-   There will be some MRT Outline Layer from Data.gov which might not tally to the MRT Outline from LTA. Let's take TE26 Marine Parade as an example

|    Our QGIS (from data.gov)    |          LTA Website           |
|:------------------------------:|:------------------------------:|
| ![](images/paste-3F5119DD.png) | ![](images/paste-3763C08A.png) |

You can see that TE26 Marine Parade Outline from Data.gov is significantly shorter than that of LTA Website. However, exit points will be flushed more together than that of LTA website and the roads near the exit points will vary significantly if we want to take **TE26 Marine Parade Outline from Data.gov as reference.** This will significantly affect our analysis (shortest distance taken) later.

Therefore, it would be better to take **TE26 Marine Parade Outline from LTA Website as reference** since it would be more accurate geographically and plot exit points out of TE26 Marine Parade MRT Outline from Data.gov. Your screen should look similar to the screenshot as shown below.

## **4. Delineating Network Service Areas with NEAT3 Plugin**

In this section, you will learn how to delineate network service areas by using QGIS Network Analysis Toolbox (QNEAT3) plugin. We will be delineating both Walking and Cycling network service areas. We will be guiding you through the delineation of Network Service Areas within TE22A Founders Memorial as an example.

### **4.1 Shortest network distance method**

#### **4.1.1 Creating Walking Network Service Area using Iso-Area as Polygons (from Layer) for TE22A Founders Memorial**

A more realistic approach to delineating service area is by using network distance. By and large, there are two approaches, namely shortest network distance and fastest network distance. In this sub-section, shortest network distance approach will be used. You will learn how to delineate service area using fastest distance approach in the next sub-section.

To delineate service area using shortest distance approach, **Iso-Area as Polygons (from Layer)** function of **QNEAT3** will be used.

-   From QGIS\'s menu bar, select **Processing** -\> **Toolbox**.

The **Processing Toolbox** panel appears.

-   Select **QNEATS3** -\> **Iso-Areas** -\> **Iso-Area as Polygons (from Layer).**

![](images/paste-EEE18854.png){width="400"}

The **Iso-Area as Polygons (From Layer**) dialog window appears.

-   For **Vector layer representing network**, select Roads from the drop-down list.

-   For **Start Points**, select TE22A Founders Memorial from the drop-down list.

Notice that both GIS layers are in projected coordinates system (i.e. EPSG:3414 which is svy21).

-   For **Unique Point ID field**, select fid from the drop-down list.

-   For **Size of Iso-Area (distance or time value)**, type 1000.

-   For **Contour Interval**, type 200.

-   For **Path type to calculate**, select Shortest Path (distance optimization) from the drop-down list.

-   For **Value for Default Speed (km/h)**, type in 4.44 

Keep the rest of the entries as default.

Your screen should look similar to the screenshot below.

![](images/paste-BD583D10.png){width="600"}
![](images/paste-38212C77.png){width="600"}

When you are ready to run the function,

-   click on the **Run** button.

The process involves massive computation and will take a while to complete (usually less than 5 mins in a standard 64bit machine).

When the process completed, two temporary layers namely: Output Polygon and Output Interpolation will be added onto Layers panel and display on QGIS View window.

![](images/paste-7A7AC651.png){width="1600"}

The Output Interpolation layer is a raster layer created using triangular irregular network (TIN). On the other hand, Output Polygon layer is a polygon feature showing the 5-km service area of Bukit Batok Fire Station by road network.

The Output Polygon is popularly known as isochrone. It is originated from Greek: iso means \"the same\" and chronos means \"time\".

#### **1.5.1.3 Creating Cycling Network Service Area using Iso-Area as Polygons (from Layer) for TE22A Founders Memorial**

Now, we will be doing the same steps to delineate the network service area for cycling

To delineate service area using shortest distance approach, **Iso-Area as Polygons (from Layer)** function of **QNEAT3** will be used.

-   From QGIS\'s menu bar, select **Processing** -\> **Toolbox**.

The **Processing Toolbox** panel appears.

-   Select **QNEATS3** -\> **Iso-Areas** -\> **Iso-Area as Polygons (from Layer)**.

The **Iso-Area as Polygons (From Layer)** dialog window appears.

-   For **Vector layer representing network**, select Roads from the drop-down list.

-   For **Start Points**, select TE22A Founders Memorial from the drop-down list.

Notice that both GIS layers are in projected coordinates system (i.e. EPSG:3414 which is svy21).

-   For **Unique Point ID field**, select fid from the drop-down list.

-   For **Size of Iso-Area (distance or time value)**, type 1500.

-   For **Contour Interval**, type 200.

-   For **Path type to calculate**, select Shortest Path (distance optimization) from the drop-down list.

-   For **Value for Default Speed (km/h)**, type in 10

Keep the rest of the entries as default.

Your screen should look similar to the screenshot below.

When you are ready to run the function,

-   click on the **Run** button.

The process involves massive computation and will take a while to complete (usually less than 5 mins in a standard 64bit machine).

When the process is completed, two temporary layers namely: Output Polygon and Output Interpolation will be added onto **Layers** panel and display on QGIS View window.

The Output Interpolation layer is a raster layer created using triangular irregular network (TIN). On the other hand, Output Polygon layer is a polygon feature showing the 5-km service area of Bukit Batok Fire Station by road network.

The Output Polygon is popularly known as isochrone. It is originated from Greek: iso means \"the same\" and chronos means \"time\".

DIY: Using the steps you had learned earlier, save the Output_Polygon Layer as TE22A Contours (Cycling) into your GeoPackage
