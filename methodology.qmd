The following is a step-by-step guide in using QGIS to complete our task.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 1. Installing QNEAT3 plugin.

Before getting started, you need to install QNEAT3 plugin.

-   From the menu bar, select Plugins -\> Manage and Install plugins

Plugins dialog window appears.

-   At the query, type **QNEAT3**.

Notice that QNEAT3 appears on the search output list.

-   Click on **QNEAT3**.

-   Click on **Install Plugin** button.

When the installation is completed, close the dialog box by

-   click on **Close** button.

In order to activate the Iso-Area as Polygon/Contour algorithms you have to add the **matplotlib** library to your QGIS-Python installation. Depending on your operating system you may install matplotlib manually using the following options:

### 1.1. Windows:

Open the OSGeo4W shell that has been installed alongside QGIS.

-   Click **Start** then type ***OSGeo4W Shell***, and hit **Enter** key.

-   At the **OSGeo4W Shell**, type the command below.

| python-qgis -m pip install matplotlib

-   Press **Enter** key.

-   When the installation is completed, restart QGIS3

### 1.2. macOS

-   Open a terminal.

-   Type the following command:

| /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.x/bin/pip3.x install matplotlib

Note: Replace the version number x according to your installation) into the terminal,

-   Press **Enter** and confirm installation with *yes* when prompted

-   Restart QGIS3

After this installation, you are ready to use all QNEAT3 Algorithms.

Before using the plugin, you must at least read the concept and methods of [Iso-area](https://root676.github.io/IsoAreaAlgs.html) because it will be used in this hands-on exercise.

## 2. Start a new QGIS Project

-   You can see from ![](images/paste-7BF607E2.png){width="500" height="25"}that 8 MRT stations have been selected. Click on ![](images/paste-8C218272.png) to push these 8 rows to the top. Your screen should look similar to the screenshot below:

    ![](images/paste-783C89F0.png)

#### 3.2.3 Saving Thomson East Coast Line Stage 4 MRT Stations into Geopackage format

-   From the main screen, select **Save selected features as**

    ![](images/paste-2C28036C.png)

Save the GIS layer into Geopackage format. Name the output layer as TEL Stage 4 MRT Stations. Your screen should look similar to the screenshot shown below:

![](images/paste-BFAC825C.png){fig-align="center" width="300"}

-   Click **OK**

-   Your screen should look similar to the screenshot below:

    ![](images/paste-4717B379.png)

### 3.3 Extracting TE Stage 4 MRT Stations Exits

However, TEL Stage 4 MRT Station Exits Layer is not currently available on any official websites. As a result, we are not able to download but can only extract out the exits with reference to the MRT layout pictures on [LTA website](https://www.lta.gov.sg/content/ltagov/en/upcoming_projects/rail_expansion/thomson_east_coast_line.html).

#### 3.3.1 Importing OSM and Opening LTA MRT Website

We will be guiding you through the extraction of TE22A Founders Memorial Exits as an example. Each MRT should have one layer with all its respective exits. Therefore, we need to create 7 more vector point layers on top of TE22A Founders Memorial Exits layer

-   Import OSM layer from **Browser**. You will need to refer to the LTA Website as you pick the exit points out. Your screen should look similar to the screenshot as shown below.

    ![](images/paste-6CD3F614.png)

-   Click the LTA Website Link as given above and scroll down till you find TE22A Founders Memorial under Location of Stations. Your screen should look similar to the screenshot as shown below:

    ![](images/paste-3BAE5613.png)

#### 3.3.2 Creating a New Layer for TE22A Founder's Memorial Exits

-   Under **Layers** at the top menu bar, hover your cursor over **Create Layers** and click on **New Shapefile Layer**.

    ![](images/paste-D292441E.png)

Your screen should similar to the screenshot below:

![](images/paste-CA52B5A4.png){fig-align="center" width="300"}

Fill n the specific information as shown in the screenshot below:

![](images/paste-3134789E.png){fig-align="center" width="300"}

-   Under the **Fields List,** click on id and delete it by clicking ![](images/paste-D24000A5.png){width="80" height="20"}

![](images/paste-05C1D015.png){fig-align="center" width="300"}

-   Now, we will start naming our attributes. Once every attribute is filled up, we can click on ![](images/paste-A41F8C08.png){width="80"} to create the field. We need the following attributes:

    1.  Fid (Type: Integer, Length: 10)

        ![](images/paste-CF5ED0FB.png){width="300"}

    2.  MRT line (Type: String, Length: 30)

        ![](images/paste-B29E85EC.png){width="300"}

    3.  Exit (Type: String, Length: 30)

        ![](images/paste-8643F463.png){width="300"}

After creating all 3 variables, your screen should look similar to the screenshot below:

![](images/paste-F59E5832.png){fig-align="center" width="300"}

-   Once you click on **OK**, you can see that TE22A Founder Memorial Exits is added to your layer Menu as a Layer as shown below:

![](images/paste-7C017547.png){fig-align="center" width="300"}

-   If you open your attribute table for TE22A Founders Memorial Exits, you will realize that the **Attribute Table** is empty. Your screen should look like the screenshot as shown below. We will be adding the exit points manually in the next section.

![](images/paste-3F7B5742.png){fig-align="center" width="300"}

#### 3.3.3 Adding Exit Points into Founders Memorial Exit Layer

-   Open the Attribute Table of TE22A Founders Memorial Exits by right-clicking it in the layer menu

![](images/paste-BA0B0BD5.png){fig-align="center" width="300"}

-   Click on ![](images/paste-B0333C09.png){width="16"} so that editing mode can be turned on so that we can start adding the exit points in.

-   Once you exit the **Attribute Table**, click on ![](images/paste-7282DAE8.png){width="16" height="16"}in the top menu and start marking the exit points out with reference to the TE22A Founders Memorial Layout from the LTA Website.

    -   Try to refer to the geographical features (eg. Roads and streets) from both the OSM layer that we previously imported, and image from the LTA website to get as accurate of an exit point as possible. For each exit points selected, fid will be in numerical order and Exits will be in alphabetical order

![](images/paste-950EA1AE.png){fig-align="center" width="300"}

-   Once both exits of TE22A Founders Memorial MRT Station has been marked out, click on **Toggle Editing**

![](images/paste-33D5DBA1.png){fig-align="center" width="300"}

-   Save the changes made by clicking **Save**

![](images/paste-1E4FE4DA.png){fig-align="center" width="300"}

-   Your screen should similar to the screenshot shown below

![](images/paste-EF0DACB4.png){fig-align="center"}

-   Let's compare this to the TE22A Founders Memorial Exits from the LTA website:

![](images/paste-839A7054.png){fig-align="center" width="600"}

-   Let's compare this to the TE22A Founders Memorial Exits from the LTA website

|            Our GIS             |          LTA Website           |
|:------------------------------:|:------------------------------:|
| ![](images/paste-102E8091.png) | ![](images/paste-50DD2DB9.png) |

-   You can see that the points are quite similar in both images but just bear in mind that these points that you have plotted will not be accurate to that of LTA website and my screenshots due to human error. However, you do not have to worry because the results will just vary slightly.

-   Now when you open your **Attribute Table** for TE22A Founders Memorial Exits, you can see that there will be 2 rows of data, reflecting the two exits for the MRT Station. Your screen should look similar to the screenshot as shown below

![](images/paste-F2C999BE.png){fig-align="center" width="300"}

::: callout-note
## DIY

Using the steps you had learned in previous hands-on exercise, save this layer into your GeoPackage as TE22A Founders Memorial MRT Exits
:::

#### 3.3.4. Explain Outliers for TE26 Marine Parade

-   There will be some MRT Outline Layer from Data.gov which might not tally to the MRT Outline from LTA. Let's take TE26 Marine Parade as an example

|    Our QGIS (from data.gov)    |          LTA Website           |
|:------------------------------:|:------------------------------:|
| ![](images/paste-3F5119DD.png) | ![](images/paste-3763C08A.png) |

You can see that TE26 Marine Parade Outline from Data.gov is significantly shorter than that of LTA Website. However, exit points will be flushed more together than that of LTA website and the roads near the exit points will vary significantly if we want to take **TE26 Marine Parade Outline from Data.gov as reference.** This will significantly affect our analysis (shortest distance taken) later.

Therefore, it would be better to take **TE26 Marine Parade Outline from LTA Website as reference** since it would be more accurate geographically and plot exit points out of TE26 Marine Parade MRT Outline from Data.gov. Your screen should look similar to the screenshot as shown below.

![](images/paste-735CAFDE.png){fig-align="center" width="600"}

#### 

3.3.5. Extracting Exit Points as Individual Layers for the rest of TE24 MRT Stations

::: callout-note
Using the steps you had learned earlier, create 7 MRT Exits layers for the rest of the MRT Stations and save them into your GeoPackage as

1.  TE23 Tanjong Rhu MRT Exits -- 2 Exits

2.  TE24 Katong Park MRT Exits -- 2 Exits

3.  TE25 Tanjong Katong MRT Exits -- 3 Exits

4.  TE26 Marine Parade MRT Exits -- 6 Exits

5.  TE27 Marine Terrace MRT Exits -- 6 Exits

6.  TE28 Siglap MRT Exits -- 4 Exits

7.  TE29 Bayshore MRT Exits -- 5 Exits

Your screen should look like the screenshot as shown below

## Be Warned

The original data is in **wgs84**. For the purpose of network analysis, the road data must be in projected coordinates system (i.e. svy21 in Singapore).
:::

#### 3.4.2. Extracting suitable road network

Since we want to study the catchment area for walking and cycling, we do not need these following road feature classes:

1.  Trunk

2.  Trunk_link

3.  Motorway

4.  Motorway_link

Therefore, we need to remove them before saving the rest of the road feature classes into our GeoPackage.

-   Open the **Attribute Table** of Clipped

    ![](images/paste-A1836F52.png){width="400"}

-   Your screen should look similar to the screenshot as shown below:

## 4. Delineating Network Service Areas with NEAT3 Plugin

In this section, you will learn how to delineate network service areas by using QGIS Network Analysis Toolbox (QNEAT3) plugin. We will be delineating both Walking and Cycling network service areas. We will be guiding you through the delineation of Network Service Areas within TE22A Founders Memorial as an example.

### 4.1 Shortest network distance method

#### 4.1.1 Creating Walking Network Service Area using Iso-Area as Polygons (from Layer) for TE22A Founders Memorial

A more realistic approach to delineating service area is by using network distance. By and large, there are two approaches, namely shortest network distance and fastest network distance. In this sub-section, shortest network distance approach will be used. You will learn how to delineate service area using fastest distance approach in the next sub-section.

To delineate service area using shortest distance approach, **Iso-Area as Polygons (from Layer)** function of **QNEAT3** will be used.

-   From QGIS's menu bar, select **Processing** -\> **Toolbox**.

The **Processing Toolbox** panel appears.

-   Select **QNEATS3** -\> **Iso-Areas** -\> **Iso-Area as Polygons (from Layer).**

![](images/paste-EEE18854.png){width="400"}

The **Iso-Area as Polygons (From Layer**) dialog window appears.

-   For **Vector layer representing network**, select Roads from the drop-down list.

-   For **Start Points**, select TE22A Founders Memorial from the drop-down list.

Notice that both GIS layers are in projected coordinates system (i.e. EPSG:3414 which is svy21).

-   For **Unique Point ID field**, select fid from the drop-down list.

-   For **Size of Iso-Area (distance or time value)**, type 1000.

-   For **Contour Interval**, type 200.

-   For **Path type to calculate**, select Shortest Path (distance optimization) from the drop-down list.

-   For **Value for Default Speed (km/h)**, type in 4.44 

Keep the rest of the entries as default.

Your screen should look similar to the screenshot below.

![](images/paste-BD583D10.png){width="600"} ![](images/paste-38212C77.png){width="600"}

When you are ready to run the function,

-   click on the **Run** button.

The process involves massive computation and will take a while to complete (usually less than 5 mins in a standard 64bit machine).

When the process completed, two temporary layers namely: Output Polygon and Output Interpolation will be added onto Layers panel and display on QGIS View window.

![](images/paste-7A7AC651.png){width="1600"}

The Output Interpolation layer is a raster layer created using triangular irregular network (TIN). On the other hand, Output Polygon layer is a polygon feature showing the 5-km service area of Bukit Batok Fire Station by road network.

The Output Polygon is popularly known as isochrone. It is originated from Greek: iso means "the same" and chronos means "time".

::: callout-note
## DIY

Using the steps you had learned earlier, save the Output_Polygon Layer as TE22A Contours (Walking) into your GeoPackage

#### **4.1.3. Creating Cycling Network Service Area using Iso-Area as Polygons (from Layer) for TE22A Founders Memorial**

Now, we will be doing the same steps to delineate the network service area for cycling

To delineate service area using shortest distance approach, **Iso-Area as Polygons (from Layer)** function of **QNEAT3** will be used.

-   From QGIS's menu bar, select **Processing** -\> **Toolbox**.

The **Processing Toolbox** panel appears.

-   Select **QNEATS3** -\>**Iso-Areas** -\> I**so-Area as Polygons (from Layer)**.

    ![](images/paste-D69A3CBA.png){width="400"}

The **Iso-Area as Polygons (From Layer)** dialog window appears.

-   For **Vector layer representing network**, select Roads from the drop-down list.

-   For **Start Points**, select TE22A Founders Memorial from the drop-down list.

Notice that both GIS layers are in projected coordinates system (i.e. EPSG:3414 which is svy21).

-   For **Unique Point ID field**, select fid from the drop-down list.

-   For **Size of Iso-Area (distance or time value)**, type 1500.

    -   For **Contour Interval**, type 200.

-   For **Path type to calculate**, select Shortest Path (distance optimization) from the drop-down list.

-   For **Value for Default Speed (km/h)**, type in 10

Keep the rest of the entries as default.

Your screen should look similar to the screenshot below.

![](images/paste-3023CFE0.png) ![](images/paste-7B433E8C.png)

When you are ready to run the function,

-   click on the **Run** button.

The process involves massive computation and will take a while to complete (usually less than 5 mins in a standard 64bit machine).

When the process is completed, two temporary layers namely: Output Polygon and Output Interpolation will be added onto **Layers** panel and display on QGIS View window.

![](images/paste-11B73704.png)

The Output Interpolation layer is a raster layer created using triangular irregular network (TIN). On the other hand, Output Polygon layer is a polygon feature showing the 5-km service area of Bukit Batok Fire Station by road network.

The Output Polygon is popularly known as isochrone. It is originated from Greek: iso means "the same" and chronos means "time".

DIY: Using the steps you had learned earlier, save the Output_Polygon Layer as TE22A Contours (Cycling) into your GeoPackage

## 5. Extracting Amenities within Catchment Areas for Amenities Analysis

### 5.1. Extracting Buildings within Catchment Areas for Amenities Analysis for TE29 Bayshore

To identify the buildings that we want, we must first open the Iso-Area layer. This way, we can see what are the buildings that fall within the catchment area that requires us to recategorize. We will be guiding you through the extraction of amenities that fall within TE29 Bayshore Contours (Walking) as an example.

#### 5.1.1. Classifying Buildings

In the Layers panel, ensure that TE29 Bayshore Contours (Walking) layer is on

-   Open the **Layer** **Properties** ofOSM_Building.

-   Click on **Symbology** tab

-   At the top of the **Symbology** dialog, change **Type** to Categorized.

    ![](images/paste-E9B8D834.png){alt="For Value, select Type" width="600"}

-   For **Value**, select Type

    ![](images/paste-7D72719B.png){width="600"}

-   Click **Classify**. Your screen should look similar to the screenshot as shown below.

    ![](images/paste-B05BC2E6.png){width="400"}

Click **OK** and your screen should look similar to the screenshot as shown below

#### ![](images/paste-F9E279D8.png){width="600"}

5.1.2. Identifying Buildings that are *NULL* within the Catchment Area

Upon closer inspection on **Attribute Table** for the OSM_Buildings layer, we find that many have null Type values. Since the Type is the property that will be able to differentiate the nature of the buildings, we will need to fix this. Therefore, we need to perform recategorizing of the building types.

-   In the Layers panel, right click on OSM_Buildings and open its **Attributes Table**. 

-   Use **Select Features by Area** or **Select Feature(s)** ![](images/paste-98BACBBE.png){width="30" height="20"} and click on one of the buildings in red in the screenshot as shown below. (Your buildings may have a different color combination)

    ![](images/paste-2B27FB97.png){width="600"}

<!-- -->

-   We see that the **Type** is null for these buildings.

![](images/paste-6D102738.png){width="600"}

Now, we will need to use external software, Google Maps or Maps, to identify our building type with existing visual data and change it in our **Attributes Table** accordingly.

-   Click on the **Toggle Editing Mode** icon ![](images/paste-824F52F1.png){width="20"} in the **Attributes Table** to allow for editing function. 

#### **5.1.3 Data Cleaning for NULL Buildings within the Catchment Area**

Below shows a table of how and why we recategorize NULL buildings into the correct building types that we use in our analysis.

<!-- -->

-   Click on **Save** when the prompt appears.

#### **5.1.4 Extracting all Buildings in Catchment Area**

Since we want to analyze the types of buildings that fall under TE29 Bayshore Contours (Walking), we need to extract them out. 

-   In the **Attributes Toolbar**, click on **Select by Location** ![](images/paste-7FEB1CFB.png){width="20"}

The **Select by Location** dialog windows appear.

-   From **Select features from**, select OSM_Buildings 

-   Tick the checkbox in front of **Intersect** under the **Where he Features** 

-   From **By Comparing to the Features from**, select TE29 Bayshore Contours (Walking). Your screen should look similar to the screenshot below.

    ![](images/paste-217AB6DB.png){width="600"}

<!-- -->

-   Click **Run**. Your screen should look similar to the screenshot as shown below.

![](images/paste-D340669C.png)\

However, we see that some buildings within the catchment area are not selected because the contour does not cover those parts. However, all buildings directly beside would be reachable within the Iso-Area of 1 km for walking and 1.5 km for cycling. Hence, we need to make sure that these buildings are also selected.

-   In the **Attributes Toolbar**, click on **Select Feature(s)**

    ![](images/paste-D509A22F.png){width="600"}

-   In your keyboard, press on the **Shift** key as you click on the additional buildings that are directly beside the Catchment Areas on your QGIS.

Now, we need to save this to our GeoPackage.

::: callout-note
## DIY

Using the steps you had learned earlier, save these selected features as a new layer as TE29\_ buildings_walking into your GeoPackage. Your screen should look similar to the screenshot as show below before clicking **OK**

\

![](images/paste-3693B4B0.png){width="400"}

-   From your Layers Menu, you can see a new layer TE29\_ buildings_walking is created

![](images/paste-DF8421B1.png){width="400" height="36"}However, since the buildings are now uncategorized, you must categorize them again. Since the null building types are updated in TE29\_ buildings_walking, no further data cleaning is required, and categorizing is enough.

## 6. Creating Buffers for Catchment Areas for Amenities Analysis

An ideal catchment area would be buffer generated based on the correct distance (1km for Walking and 1.5km for Cycling). We will compare Iso-Area and buffer to see their differences. From here, we can see if a better road network is required for people to walk or cycle more efficiently. We will be guiding you through the creation of buffers for TE29 Bayshore Contours (Walking) as an example.

### 6.1. Generating Buffer

-   Under Vector from **Menu Toolbar**, hover your cursor over Geoprocessing Tools, and click on the Buffer

    ![](images/paste-C5466398.png){width="400"}

<!-- -->

-   From Input layer, select TE29 Bayshore Contours (Walking)

-   From Distance, change the values depending on the contour you are doing

    -   If you are doing walking contour, change the value to 1000

    -   If you are doing cycling contour, change the value to 1500

<!-- -->

-   From Segments, type 100

Your screen should look similar to the screenshot as shown below.

![](images/paste-7D6377A4.png){fig-align="center" width="400"}

-   Click **Run**

You can see that a temporary Buffered layer is created from your Layers panel

![](images/paste-899B1B79.png){fig-align="center" width="400"}

Your screen should look similar to the screenshot as shown below.

![](images/paste-6B139C7F.png){fig-align="center" width="600"}

::: callout-note
## DIY

Using the steps you had learned earlier, save these selected features as a new layer as TE29\_ walking_buffer into your GeoPackage. Your screen should look similar to the screenshot as show below before clicking **OK**
:::

![](images/paste-53A9646F.png){fig-align="center" width="400"}

### 6.1.2. Data Cleaning of Buffer

To allow the other building layers to be seen, we can make the buffer translucent like the contours.

::: callout-note
## DIY

Using the steps you had learned earlier, open **Symbology** tab of TE29\_ walking_buffer by opening its Layer Properties
:::

-   From **Layer Rendering**, drop **Opacity** to 40%. Your screen should look like the screenshot as shown below before clicking **OK**

    ![](images/paste-559D6CB8.png){width="600"}

<!-- -->

-   Click **OK**. Your screen should look similar to the screenshot as shown below.

![](images/paste-7124160A.png){fig-align="center" width="600"}

We can reorder and place TE29\_ walking_buffer below TE29 Bayshore Contours (Walking), TE29_buildings_walking and TE29_pois_walking in the Layers panel to not block the contour and buildings layer for clear visibility.

## 7. Creating Layouts for Amenities Analysis

To analyze what are the buildings and POIs within the catchment area that are affected by the MRT stations, other than categorizing them into their building types and POI class, we want to get the count of these categories. This way, we can get deeper insights as to who exactly are those that are affected by the MRT, and how many of these people are affected. We will do so by making use of the bar graph plot functionality in QGIS to plot the count of these amenities. We will be guiding you through the creation of TE29 Bayshore Contours (Walking) amenities layout as an example.

### 7.1. Getting Counts for Both Buildings and POIs

::: callout-note
## DIY

Using the steps that you learnt earlier, open DB Manager and select either TE29_buildings_walking or TE29_pois_walking under Project Layers.
:::

-   Click on the SQL Window icon ![](images/paste-40D7173F.png){width="20" height="18"}.

-   In the query, write these SQL codes depending on which layer you start first:

    -   TE29_buildings_walking

        ![](images/paste-44AEEFBF.png){width="600"}

    -   TE29_pois_walking

        ![](images/paste-BEB63429.png){width="600"}

<!-- -->

-   Click **Execute**

After inspecting the query loaded and making sure that it is correct, whereby there is a type and count column, you can proceed to save this query you created. The query loaded should similar to the screenshot as shown below.

![](images/paste-C8E99DE5.png){width="300"}

::: callout-note
## DIY

Using the steps that you learnt earlier, load both counts into new layers and save them as new layers TE29_FINAL_BUILDINGS_WALKING and TE29_FINAL_POIS_WALKING into your GeoPackage

## 8. Creating Choropleth Maps for Catchment Population for Population Analysis

### 8.1. Creating Common Attribute

Before you merge 2020POP and MP19_Subzone together, you need to have a common attribute. By opening **Attribute Table** of 2020POP, you will see the following columns

![](images/paste-7F94A258.png){width="600"}

By opening **Attribute Table** of MP19_Subzone, you will see the following columns as well

![](images/paste-D01084AE.png){width="800"}

However, you see that it is quite messy, so you need to filter out columns that do not provide much information to you.

-   Click on **Organize Columns** ![](images/paste-D6DCF1DD.png) and uncheck these following columns before clicking **OK**

::: {layout-ncol="2"}
![](images/paste-987F1BFB.png)

![](images/paste-AE570F89.png){width="334"}
:::

You will see that your **Attribute Table** for MP19_Subzone is so much cleaner now

![](images/paste-CE694802.png)

If you look at both **Attribute Tables** carefully, you will realize that the column 'SZ' in 2020POP is in lower case of column 'SUBZONE_N' in MP19_Subzone. Therefore, we need to use subzone names to merge both 2020POP and MP19_Subzone together.

-   Go to 2020POP's **Attribute Table** and select **Open Field Calculator**![](images/paste-E60BBB07.png){width="20" height="22"} at the top. A pop-up window will appear as shown below

    ![](images/paste-2B058F90.png){width="800"}

-   As we aim to capitalize the string data in 'SZ' column, fill in the **Output Field Name** and the **Output Field Type** as shown below.

    ![](images/paste-0D5C1001.png){width="1000"}

-   Type the following code as shown below

![](images/paste-B39D124F.png)

The preview will show you what the new string will be in the new column 'SUBZONE'

-   Click **OK** and you will see that a new column 'SUBZONE' is added to your 2020POP's **Attribute Table**

![](images/paste-E5D6DE1C.png)

However, the table will be in edit format, so you need to save the changes that you had made.

-   Click on ![](images/paste-A2D71350.png){width="20"} (top left of your screen). A pop-up will appear as shown below and click **Save**

![](images/paste-F1C3C74F.png){width="400"}

### 8.2. Performing Relational Join Between MP19_Subzone and 2020POP layers

Now you are ready to perform relational join between the MP19_Subzone layer and the 2020POP layer. To join the **Attribute Table** of a geospatial data and an aspatial **Attribute Table**, we need to identify the common key or popularly known as **Unique Identifier** between these two data sets with we had prepared earlier. In this case, it is the Subzone Names ('SUBZONE' and 'SUBZONE_N')

![](images/paste-B2539C7F.png)

You are ready to join both tables now.

-   From the **Layers** panel, double-click on MP19_Subzone layer.

The **Layer Properties** dialog window appears.

-   From the **Tab** menu, click on the **Joins** tab.

Your screen should look similar to the screenshot below.

![](images/paste-74C979A5.png)

-   Click on **Add** **New Join** icon ![](images/paste-F805EA95.png){width="20"}

The **Add Vector Join** dialog window appears.

-   For **Join Layer**, select 2020POP from the drop-down list.

-   For **Join field**, select SUBZONE from the drop-down list.

-   For **Target field**, select SUBZONE_N from the drop-down list.

    ![](images/paste-777321BB.png)

-   Click on **OK** button to perform the relational join.

You will return to the **Layer Properties** dialog window.

Notice that a relational joined between 2020POP **Attribute Table** and the **Attribute Table** of MP19_Subzone has been created.

-   At the **Layer Properties** dialog window, click on the **OK** button.

Strange, it seems that nothing had happened!

-   At the **Layers** panel, right click on MP19_Subzone layer and select open **Attribute Table** from the context menu.

You will notice that the table now contains additional fields from 2020POP attribute layer.

![](images/paste-8E682C43.png)

Remember that this joint is temporary. It is not part of the **Attribute Table** of MP19_Subzone layer but is just linked dynamically to the 2020POP layer. If you want to permanently join the attributes, you must save it as a new layer.

-   To double check if both attribute tables are joined properly, click on ![](images/paste-11FD368E.png){width="20"}

If the rows are not joined properly, values belonging to 2020POP in **Attribute Table** of MP19_Subzone will reflect as NULL. Therefore, we will have to find NULL values by using the following expression as shown below

-   Type the following code as shown in the screenshot below

    ![](images/paste-20848659.png){width="1000"}

-   Click on **Select Features** 

You can tell that from ![](images/paste-F786FF5C.png){width="400"} that 0 row is selected which means that both attributes' tables are joined properly

### 8.3. Creating Choropleth Map for Subzone Population

In this section, you will learn how to create a choropleth map showing the distribution of 2020 population in 2020POP by MP19_Subzone.

You are ready to prepare the choropleth now.

-   From the **Layers** panel, double-click on **MP19_Subzone** layer.

The **Layer Properties** dialog window appears.

-   Click on **Symbology** tab.

-   At **Symbol** selection drop-down list, select Graduated from the drop-down list.

-   For **Value**, select 2020POP_total_pop from the drop-down list.

### 8.4. Calculating Catchment Population

We will be guiding you through the calculation of Catchment Population for TE27 Marine Terrace Contours (Walking) as an example.

#### 8.4.1. Creating a 'Subzone_Area' column for MP19_Subzone

To calculate the Catchment Population, we need to find out the ratio of Subzone Catchment Area to its Subzone Area for all subzones that falls within each contour line first. 

DIY: Using the steps that you learned earlier, open **Attribute Table** of MP19_Subzone and click on **Open Field Calculator**. Your screen should look similar to the screenshot as shown below

![](images/paste-7DC396DF.png)

We want to create a new column 'Subzone_Area' for each subzone area.

-   Type the following code as shown in the screenshot below before clicking **OK**

![](images/paste-EC3F8EA5.png)

You will see that a new column 'Subzone_Area' is now created in the **Attribute Table** of MP19_Subzone

![](images/paste-85FD8C07.png)

::: callout-note
## DIY

Using the steps that you learnt earlier, save the changes made and filter out unnecessary columns in the **Attribute Table** of MP19_Subzone. Your screen should look similar to the screenshot as shown below.

-   Select the correct layers for your **Input and Overlay layers** as shown in the screenshot below

![](images/paste-4F980C9F.png)

::: callout-note
## DIY

With the steps that you learnt earlier, for better performance, select Do Not Filter (Better Performance) from under **Invalid feature filtering** for both input and overlap layers before clicking **Run**. Your screen should look like the screenshot as shown below. 
:::

You can see that a temporary layer Union is created in your layer menu.

![](images/paste-6B33C082.png)

Let's analyze the **Attribute Table** of this Temporary layer Union. 

DIY: With the steps that you learnt earlier, open the **Attribute Table** of Union. Your screen should look similar to the screenshot as shown below

![](images/paste-44E6E373.png)

You can see that it is very messy, thus filtering of column is required.

::: callout-note
## DIY

With the steps that you learnt earlier, filter out unnecessary columns and leave those columns checked as shown in the screenshot below. Your screen should look similar to the screenshot as shown below.
:::

![](images/paste-9B9B982B.png)

Since you only need the rows for those in the catchment polygon layers, you need to do further data filtering.

::: callout-note
## DIY

Using the steps that you learnt earlier, click on **Select by Expression** and type in the following code as shown below before clicking **Select Features**
:::

![](images/paste-2AF751A8.png)

You can see from ![](images/paste-AEF49DCA.png){width="300" height="24"} that 25 rows are selected based on the condition that we had set. Now you want to save these 25 rows as TE27 Population (Walking) into your GeoPackage. However, you need to ensure that these 25 rows have a unique fid first.

![](images/paste-7A40B316.png)

::: callout-note
## DIY

Using the steps that you learnt earlier, manually change all the fid of the selected rows starting from 1 to 25 and save it. Your screen should look similar to the screenshot as shown below.
:::

![](images/paste-6BE69CE9.png)

Once that is done, you can now save the selected feature into your GeoPackage now

::: callout-note
## DIY

Using the steps that you learnt earlier, save the selected features as a layer as TE27 Population (Walking) into your GeoPackage
:::

![](images/paste-2D15E550.png)

You can see that a permanent layer called TE27 Population (Walking) is now created in your **Layer** menu as shown below.

![](images/paste-FE077ABB.png)

#### **8.4.3. Creating a 'Catchment\_ Subzone_Area' Column**

To calculate the Catchment Subzone Area, we need to open the **Attribute Table** for TE27 Population (Walking). 

::: callout-note
## DIY

Using the steps that you learnt earlier, open the **Attribute Table** for TE27 Population (Walking). Your screen should look similar to the screenshot as shown below.
:::

![](images/paste-8C7CCD81.png)

You can still see that the **Attribute Table** contains a lot of unnecessary columns, thus we need to conduct filtering 

::: callout-note
## DIY

Using the steps that you learnt earlier, filter out unnecessary columns and leave those columns as shown below. Your screen should look similar to the screenshot as shown below
:::

![](images/paste-68077749.png)

Now we need to find out the area of the Catchment Subzone Area using **Open Field Calculator**

::: callout-note
## DIY

Using the steps that you learnt earlier, create a new column for Catchment_Area using the following code as shown in the screenshot below before clicking **OK**
:::

![](images/paste-2008C453.png)

Your **Attribute Table** should reflect the additional 'Catchment_Area' created as shown in the screenshot below. 

![](images/paste-A3C6A690.png)

::: callout-note
## DIY

Using the steps that you learnt earlier, save the changes made to the **Attribute Table** of TE27 Population (Walking)
:::

#### **8.4.4. Creating a 'Ratio' Column for TE27 Population (Walking)**

Assuming that Population is equally distributed across the subzone area, you need to calculate the percentage of Catchment Area to respective Subzone Area. Since now you have both Catchment Subzone Area and Subzone Area, this is now possible.

::: callout-note
## DIY

Using the steps that you learnt earlier, create a new column 'Ratio' using the **Open Field Calculator** in the **Attribute Table** and type in the following code as shown below before clicking **OK**
:::

![](images/paste-770D8891.png)

Your **Attribute Table** should reflect the additional 'Ratio' created as shown in the screenshot below. 

![](images/paste-7E096E7B.png)

::: callout-note
## DIY

Using the steps that you learnt earlier, save the changes made to the **Attribute Table** of TE27 Population (Walking)
:::

#### **8.4.5. Creating a 'Catchment_Population' Column**

Since now we have the ratio, we will calculate Catchment Population by multiplying the Subzone Population and respective ratio per subzone and contour. The assumption made above still holds.

::: callout-note
## DIY

Using the steps that you learnt earlier, create a new column 'Catchment_Population' using the **Open Field Calculator** in the **Attribute Table** and type in the following code as shown below before clicking **OK**
:::

![](images/paste-06FE1910.png)

Your **Attribute Table** should reflect the additional 'Catchment_Population' created as shown in the screenshot below.

## DIY

Using the steps that you learnt earlier, save the changes made to the **Attribute Table** of TE27 Population (Walking)
:::

### 8.5. Creating a Choropleth Map for Catchment Population

To better present the data, it would be better to represent the Catchment Population in the form of a Choropleth Map with OSM and MP19_Subzone Layers

#### **8.5.1. Creating a Choropleth Map for Catchment Population**

::: callout-note
## DIY

Using the steps that you learnt earlier, open the **Layer Properties** for TE27 Population (Walking) and click on the **Symbology** tab.
:::

Our value for Catchment Population Choropleth Map would be 'Catchment_Population'. But wait! You can see from the screenshot below that this column is not present anywhere in the list of values as shown in the screenshot below.

![](images/paste-3A232904.png)

Is there any way to overcome this? Of course!

-   Click on the ![](images/paste-A4E77577.png){width="20" height="22"} on the right side of **Symbol**. A pop-up should appear as shown in the screenshot below.

    ![](images/paste-18571AD6.png)

<!-- -->

-   Type in the following code as shown below before clicking **OK**

    ![](images/paste-CC7A48EE.png)

Now you can see that 'Catchment_Population' is reflected as the value as shown in the screenshot below.

::: callout-note
## DIY

Using the steps that you learnt earlier, generate a **Choropleth Map** for Catchment Population. Your **Symbology** screen should look similar to the screenshot as shown below before clicking **OK**
:::

![](images/paste-C698B335.png){fig-align="center"}

Now, you can see that a **Choropleth Map** is generated based on TE27 Contours (Walking)

![](images/paste-A4191F7B.png){fig-align="center"}

#### **8.5.1. Making a Transparent Fill for MP19_Subzone Layer**

However, this isn't visibly pleasing. If we can show the division of MP19_Subzone and the OSM layer, it can provide us with more information for better analysis. 

::: callout-note
## DIY

Using the steps that you learnt earlier, open the **Symbology** tab for MP19_Subzone layer.
:::

![](images/paste-124E55EF.png){fig-align="center"}

-   Click on **Simple Fill** under **Fill**. Your screen should look similar to the screenshot as shown below.

    ![](images/paste-D0D5F7DC.png)

-   Select Transparent Fill under **Fill** color

    ![](images/paste-C6D3EAA1.png)

-   Increase **Stroke Width** to 1 before clicking **OK**

    ![](images/paste-B8EF7D6F.png)

Now you can see from your main screen, 

1.  Each Subzone is divided distinctly 

2.  Each part of the Contour that falls in their respective Subzone

3.  Nearby amenities (Transport, POIs and Buildings) within the Contours

![](images/paste-0C8E5AFC.png)

::: callout-note
## DIY

Using the steps that you learnt earlier, generate **Choropleth Maps** for both Walking and Cycling Contours for the rest of the **TEL Stage 4 MRT Stations**.
