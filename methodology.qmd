## 1. Installing QNEAT3 plugin.

Before getting started, you need to install QNEAT3 plugin.

-   From the menu bar, select Plugins -\> Manage and Install plugins

Plugins dialog window appears.

-   At the query, type **QNEAT3**.

Notice that QNEAT3 appears on the search output list.

-   Click on **QNEAT3**.

-   Click on **Install Plugin** button.

When the installation is completed, close the dialog box by

-   click on **Close** button.

In order to activate the Iso-Area as Polygon/Contour algorithms you have to add the **matplotlib** library to your QGIS-Python installation. Depending on your operating system you may install matplotlib manually using the following options:

### 1.1. Windows:

Open the OSGeo4W shell that has been installed alongside QGIS.

-   Click **Start** then type ***OSGeo4W Shell***, and hit **Enter** key.

-   At the **OSGeo4W Shell**, type the command below.

| python-qgis -m pip install matplotlib

-   Press **Enter** key.

-   When the installation is completed, restart QGIS3

### 1.2. macOS

-   Open a terminal.

-   Type the following command:

| /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.x/bin/pip3.x install matplotlib

Note: Replace the version number x according to your installation) into the terminal,

-   Press **Enter** and confirm installation with *yes* when prompted

-   Restart QGIS3

After this installation, you are ready to use all QNEAT3 Algorithms.

Before using the plugin, you must at least read the concept and methods of [Iso-area](https://root676.github.io/IsoAreaAlgs.html) because it will be used in this hands-on exercise.

## 2. Start a new QGIS Project

::: callout-tip
DIY: Using the steps you had learned in previous hands-on exercise, start a new QGIS project. Save the project and give it a name (i.e. GIS_Project).
:::

**Reminder:** Ensure that svy21 projection system is used.

## 3. Data Preparation

### 3.1 Downloading Master Plan

2019 Subzone Boundary (No Sea) layer

-   Download Master Plan 2019 Subzone Boundary (No Sea) Data from data.gov.sg and import it into QGIS.

-   In data.gov.sg portal, Master Plan 2019 Subzone Boundary (No Sea) data set is in kml and geojson formats. Import the kml format into QGIS as a GIS layer.

-   Save the GIS layer into GeoPackage format. Name the output layer as MP19_Subzone.

::: callout-caution
## Be Warned

The original data is in **wgs84**. For the purpose of network analysis, the GIS data must be be in projected coordinates system (i.e. SVY21 for Singapore).

### 3.2 Downloading Master Plan 2019 Rail Station layer

#### 3.2.1 Importing Master Plan 2019 Rail Station Layer

-   Download Rail Station Data from data.gov.sg and import it into QGIS.

-   In data.gov.sg portal, Master Plan 2019 Rail Station data set is in kml and geojson formats.

-   Import the kml format into QGIS as a GIS layer.

Your screen should look similar to the screenshot as shown below:
