[Presently, private transportation is preferred due to its ease and comfort.](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/car-sale-coe-prices-premiums-driving-covid-19-pandemic-2295731) \n\n## Objectives & Methodology\n\nAs a result, this study aims to see how convenient TEL Stage 4 MRTS stations are for first and last mile journeys of Singaporeans and its accessibility by walking and cycling. Amenities and Population analysis will be conducted to assess its suitability to encourage Singaporeans to use public transportation. These are the steps that we will take:\n\n1.  Use QNEAT3 to obtain the Iso-Areas and Buffer Regions for all TEL Stage 4 MRT Stations\n\n2.  Conduct categorization of Buildings and Points of Interests for Amenities Analysis\n\n3.  Calculation of Catchment Area and Catchment Population at Subzone Level for Population Analysis\n\n4.  Analysis and Lesson Learnt from Amenities and Population Analysis\n\n## Key Findings\n\nAt the end of our study, we are able to find that all MRT stations are effective in improving Singaporeans\\' first and last mile journeys due to greater convenience and accessibility. On top of that, the catchment area that the population TEL serves are useful due to the lack of public transportation in these regions.\n\nWe found that TE27 Marine Terrace and TE26 Marine Parade are on par in being the most effective station in encouraging public transport use because the amenities in these areas are of high density usage, thus enabling these stations to reach the largest number of people as well.\n\nOn the other hand, TE22A Founder\\'s Memorial\\'s location may not be ideal for encouraging public transportation as it is the least effective in reaching out to a variety of amenities, and a large population.\n\nTherefore, with the effectiveness of these MRT stations, we can conclude how well first and last mile journey, through walking or cycling, has been improved.\n\n## Posters\n\n### Townhall Poster\n\nHere is the poster used at the Townhall presentation:\n\n![](images/Poster.png)\n\nHere are the posters belonging to the QR codes:\n\n### TE22A -- Founders Memorial\n\n![](images/TE22A%20Founder%20Memorial-01.png)\n\n### TE23 -- Tanjong Rhu\n\n![](images/TE23%20Tanjong%20Rhu-02.png)\n\n### TE24 -- Katong Park\n\n![](images/TE24%20Katong%20Park-01.png)\n\n### TE25 -- Tanjong Katong\n\n![](images/TE25%20Tanjong%20Katong-01.png)\n\n### TE26 -- Marine Parade\n\n![](images/TE26%20Marine%20Parade-01.png)\n\n### TE27 -- Marine Terrace\n\n![](images/TE27%20Marine%20Terrace-01.png)\n\n### TE28 -- Siglap\n\n![](images/TE28%20Siglap-01.png)\n\n### TE29 -- Bayshore\n\n![](images/TE29%20Bayshore-01.png)\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-yaml":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["styles.css"],"toc":true,"output-file":"index.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.1.251","editor":"visual","theme":"yeti","title":"Catch Them All: The Study of TE Stage 4 MRT Stations' Catchment Areas"},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
