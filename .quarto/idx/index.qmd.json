It hopes to better serve communities living in the North-South corridor and the East by cutting down travel times to the Central area from 55min to 35min.\n\nThis is in conjunction with [Singapore's Green Plan](https://www.greenplan.gov.sg/) which, among others, aims to significantly reduce our carbon emissions and ensure that Singapore is more sustainable. One way would be to reduce demand for private transportation.\n\nStage 1 (from [Woodlands North to Woodlands South](https://www.lta.gov.sg/content/ltagov/en/newsroom/2019/12/1/public_preview_of_thomson-east_coast_line1_stations_on_11january.html)) opened on 31 January 2020. Stage 2 (from [Springleaf to Caldecott](https://www.lta.gov.sg/content/ltagov/en/newsroom/2019/12/1/public_preview_of_thomson-east_coast_line1_stations_on_11january.html)) opened on 28 August 2021. Stage 3 (from Stevens to Gardens by the Bay), is [opening on 13 November 2022](https://www.lta.gov.sg/content/ltagov/en/newsroom/2022/10/news-releases/thomson---east-coast-line-stage-3-to-open-for-passenger-service-.html).\n\nOur focus is on the Stage 4 stations (Founders Memorial to Bayshore) , which are currently in the works and [will be opened by 2024](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/thomson-east-coast-line-open-november-mrt-free-rides-11-stations-2994101#:~:text=Stage%204%2C%20which%20comprises%20eight,expected%20to%20open%20in%202024.).\n\n## Problem and Aim\n\n[Presently, however, private transportation is preferred due to its ease and comfort.](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/car-sale-coe-prices-premiums-driving-covid-19-pandemic-2295731) As a result, this study aims to see how accessible and convenient TEL Stage 4 MRT stations are for first and last mile journeys. We will do so by analysing two ways in which Singaporeans may get to the MRT -- walking or cycling. This will prove whether the construction of TEL Stage 4 MRT is competent to successfully encourage people to use public transportation.\n\n## Motivation\n\nWith [Singapore Green Plan 2030](https://www.greenplan.gov.sg/key-focus-areas/energy-reset/), we want to explore how the expansion of TEL Stage 4 MRT Stations can help in making public transportation and Singapore more sustainable and greener.\n\n## Deliverables\n\n### Deliverable 1\n\nWe will provide both the buffer regions and the ISO-areas (using QNEAT3) of the aforementioned stations. The maximum walking distance for both buffer and ISO-area is 1000m while maximum cycling distance is 1500m.\n\n### Deliverable 2\n\nAfterwards, we will be conducting an analysis of the various amenities and buildings that lie within the catchment area.\n\n### Deliverable 3\n\nWe will also find the population size of the people served by this line by using the composite subzone areas and population.\n\n## Posters\n\n### Townhall Poster\n\nHere is the poster used at the Townhall presentation:\n\n![](images/Poster.png)\n\nHere are the posters for the other stations:\n\n### TE22A\n\n![](images/TE22A%20Founder%20Memorial-01.png)\n\n### TE23\n\n![](images/TE23%20Tanjong%20Rhu-02.png)\n\n### TE24\n\n![](images/TE24%20Katong%20Park-01.png)\n\n### TE25\n\n![](images/TE25%20Tanjong%20Katong-01.png)\n\n### TE26\n\n![](images/TE26%20Marine%20Parade-01.png)\n\n### TE27\n\n![](images/TE27%20Marine%20Terrace-01.png)\n\n### TE28\n\n![](images/TE28%20Siglap-01.png)\n\n### TE29\n\n![](images/TE29%20Bayshore-01.png)\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-yaml":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["styles.css"],"toc":true,"output-file":"index.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.1.251","editor":"visual","theme":"yeti","title":"Catch Them All"},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
