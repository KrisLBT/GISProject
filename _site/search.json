It hopes to better serve communities living in the North-South corridor and the East by cutting down travel times to the Central area from 55min to 35min.\nThis is in conjunction with Singapore’s Green Plan which, among others, aims to significantly reduce our carbon emissions and ensure that Singapore is more sustainable. One way would be to reduce demand for private transportation.\nOur focus is on the Stage 4 stations(Founders Memorial to Bayshore) , which are currently in the works and will be opened by 2025."

As a result, this study aims to see how accessible and convenient TEL Stage 4 MRT stations are for first and last mile journeys. We will do so by analysing two ways in which Singaporeans may get to the MRT - walking or cycling. This will prove whether the construction of TEL Stage 4 MRT is competent to successfully encourage people to use public transportation."

    "text": "Motivations\nAccording to the Singapore Green Plan, the government wishes to substantially reduce our carbon emissions in order to combat climate change. One such way it aims to achieve this is by encouraging public transport instead of private transport.\nAt present, most Singapore residents use public transport such as buses and trains. This is due to the costliness in purchasing and maintaining a car. However, many people still find public transportation to be insufficient, with many wealthier people and families opting for car ownership instead. This is partially driven by the comfort and ease that driving provides to its riders.\nHowever, this contributes to our carbon emissions and makes meeting the goals set by the Green Plan difficult to achieve. This is compounded by the fact that car ownership is a negative externality. Despite the convenience it affords to its owners, it aggravates traffic and is a source of various types of pollution apart from air pollution, such as noise.\nThis points to a need to strengthen our public transportation system and to accommodate the diverse needs of Singapore residents."
