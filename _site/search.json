It hopes to better serve communities living in the North-South corridor and the East by cutting down travel times to the Central area from 55min to 35min.\nThis is in conjunction with Singapore’s Green Plan which, among others, aims to significantly reduce our carbon emissions and ensure that Singapore is more sustainable. One way would be to reduce demand for private transportation.\nOur focus is on the Stage 4 stations(Founders Memorial to Bayshore) , which are currently in the works and will be opened by 2025."

As a result, this study aims to see how accessible and convenient TEL Stage 4 MRT stations are for first and last mile journeys. We will do so by analysing two ways in which Singaporeans may get to the MRT - walking or cycling. This will prove whether the construction of TEL Stage 4 MRT is competent to successfully encourage people to use public transportation."

    "text": "Motivations\nAccording to the Singapore Green Plan, the government wishes to substantially reduce our carbon emissions in order to combat climate change. One such way it aims to achieve this is by encouraging public transport instead of private transport.\nAt present, most Singapore residents use public transport such as buses and trains. This is due to the costliness in purchasing and maintaining a car. However, many people still find public transportation to be insufficient, with many wealthier people and families opting for car ownership instead. This is partially driven by the comfort and ease that driving provides to its riders.\nHowever, this contributes to our carbon emissions and makes meeting the goals set by the Green Plan difficult to achieve. This is compounded by the fact that car ownership is a negative externality. Despite the convenience it affords to its owners, it aggravates traffic and is a source of various types of pollution apart from air pollution, such as noise.\nThis points to a need to strengthen our public transportation system and to accommodate the diverse needs of Singapore residents."

We subsequently used the buffer region using the Euclidean distance of the same values. We then also found the potential population served by the stations. Assuming the population is spread out equally, we used ratio of the subzone area covered by the ISO-area to the total subzone area as a proxy for population percentage served by train station.\nThe following is a step-by-step guide in using QGIS to complete our task."

Import the kml format into QGIS as a GIS layer.\nSave the GIS layer into GeoPackage format. Name the output layer as MP19_Subzone.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYour screen should look like this screenshot as shown below\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBe Warned\n\n\n\nThe original data is in wgs84. For the purpose of network analysis, the GIS data must be be in projected coordinates system (i.e. SVY21 for Singapore).\n\n\n\n\n3.2 Downloading Master Plan 2019 Rail Station layer\n\n3.2.1 Importing Master Plan 2019 Rail Station Layer\n\nDownload Rail Station Data from data.gov.sg and import it into QGIS.\nIn data.gov.sg portal, Master Plan 2019 Rail Station data set is in kml and geojson formats.\nImport the kml format into QGIS as a GIS layer.\n\nYour screen should look similar to the screenshot as shown below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBe Warned\n\n\n\nThe original data is in wgs84.

As a result, we are not able to download but can only extract out the exits with reference to the MRT layout pictures on LTA website.\n\n3.3.1 Importing OSM and Opening LTA MRT Website\nWe will be guiding you through the extraction of TE22A Founders Memorial Exits as an example. Each MRT should have one layer with all its respective exits. Therefore, we need to create 7 more vector point layers on top of TE22A Founders Memorial Exits layer\n\nImport OSM layer from Browser. You will need to refer to the LTA Website as you pick the exit points out. Your screen should look similar to the screenshot as shown below.\n\nClick the LTA Website Link as given above and scroll down till you find TE22A Founders Memorial under Location of Stations. Your screen should look similar to the screenshot as shown below:\n\n\n\n\n3.3.2 Creating a New Layer for TE22A Founder’s Memorial Exits\n\nUnder Layers at the top menu bar, hover your cursor over Create Layers and click on New Shapefile Layer.\n\n\nYour screen should similar to the screenshot below:\n\n\n\n\n\nFill n the specific information as shown in the screenshot below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnder the Fields List, click on id and delete it by clicking \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, we will start naming our attributes. Once every attribute is filled up, we can click on  to create the field. We need the following attributes:\n\nFid (Type: Integer, Length: 10)\n\nMRT line (Type: String, Length: 30)\n\nExit (Type: String, Length: 30)\n\n\n\nAfter creating all 3 variables, your screen should look similar to the screenshot below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce you click on OK, you can see that TE22A Founder Memorial Exits is added to your layer Menu as a Layer as shown below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you open your attribute table for TE22A Founders Memorial Exits, you will realize that the Attribute Table is empty. Your screen should look like the screenshot as shown below. We will be adding the exit points manually in the next section.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.3.3 Adding Exit Points into Founders Memorial Exit Layer\n\nOpen the Attribute Table of TE22A Founders Memorial Exits by right-clicking it in the layer menu\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick on  so that editing mode can be turned on so that we can start adding the exit points in.\nOnce you exit the Attribute Table, click on in the top menu and start marking the exit points out with reference to the TE22A Founders Memorial Layout from the LTA Website.\n\nTry to refer to the geographical features (eg. Roads and streets) from both the OSM layer that we previously imported, and image from the LTA website to get as accurate of an exit point as possible. For each exit points selected, fid will be in numerical order and Exits will be in alphabetical order\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce both exits of TE22A Founders Memorial MRT Station has been marked out, click on Toggle Editing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSave the changes made by clicking Save\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYour screen should similar to the screenshot shown below\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet’s compare this to the TE22A Founders Memorial Exits from the LTA website:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet’s compare this to the TE22A Founders Memorial Exits from the LTA website\n\n\n\n\nOur GIS\nLTA Website\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can see that the points are quite similar in both images but just bear in mind that these points that you have plotted will not be accurate to that of LTA website and my screenshots due to human error. However, you do not have to worry because the results will just vary slightly.\nNow when you open your Attribute Table for TE22A Founders Memorial Exits, you can see that there will be 2 rows of data, reflecting the two exits for the MRT Station. Your screen should look similar to the screenshot as shown below\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDIY\n\n\n\nUsing the steps you had learned in previous hands-on exercise, save this layer into your GeoPackage as TE22A Founders Memorial MRT Exits\n\n\n\n\n3.3.4. Explain Outliers for TE26 Marine Parade\n\nThere will be some MRT Outline Layer from Data.gov which might not tally to the MRT Outline from LTA. Let's take TE26 Marine Parade as an example\n\n\n\n\nOur QGIS (from data.gov)\nLTA Website\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can see that TE26 Marine Parade Outline from Data.gov is significantly shorter than that of LTA Website. However, exit points will be flushed more together than that of LTA website and the roads near the exit points will vary significantly if we want to take TE26 Marine Parade Outline from Data.gov as reference. This will significantly affect our analysis (shortest distance taken) later.\nTherefore, it would be better to take TE26 Marine Parade Outline from LTA Website as reference since it would be more accurate geographically and plot exit points out of TE26 Marine Parade MRT Outline from Data.gov. Your screen should look similar to the screenshot as shown below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.3.5. Extracting Exit Points as Individual Layers for the rest of TE24 MRT Stations\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nUsing the steps you had learned earlier, create 7 MRT Exits layers for the rest of the MRT Stations and save them into your GeoPackage as\n\nTE23 Tanjong Rhu MRT Exits – 2 Exits\nTE24 Katong Park MRT Exits – 2 Exits\nTE25 Tanjong Katong MRT Exits – 3 Exits\nTE26 Marine Parade MRT Exits – 6 Exits\nTE27 Marine Terrace MRT Exits – 6 Exits\nTE28 Siglap MRT Exits – 4 Exits\nTE29 Bayshore MRT Exits – 5 Exits\n\nYour screen should look like the screenshot as shown below\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.4 Extracting and Preparing road network layer\nI can't emphasize enough the importance of a quality data preparation in GIS analysis. In this sub-section, you will use basic QGIS functions to perform the following data preparation tasks:\n\nselecting all roads features with the study area\nextracting appropriate road classes for the analysis\n\n\n3.4.1. Selecting all Road network with the study area\n\nImport road data set of OSMinto QGIS. Your screen should look similar to the screenshot as shown below)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnder Vector from the menu bar, hover your cursor over Geoprocessing Tools and click on the Clip\n\nSelect the correct layers for Input and Output layers as shown in the screenshot below:\n\nFor Input Layer, click on . Your screen should look similar to the screenshot as shown below:\n\nFor better performance, select Do Not Filter (Better Performance) from Invalid feature filtering as shown in the screenshot below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDIY\n\n\n\nUsing the steps you learned earlier, do the same thing fo Output Layer\n\n\n\nClick on to extract out the roads in Singapore. It will take awhile for QGIS to run due to large data to process but once the process is completed, a new temporary layer Clipped should appear in your Layers Menu.\nYour screen should look like the screenshot as shown below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBe Warned\n\n\n\nThe original data is in wgs84. For the purpose of network analysis, the road data must be in projected coordinates system (i.e. svy21 in Singapore).\n\n\n\n\n3.4.2. Extracting suitable road network\nSince we want to study the catchment area for walking and cycling, we do not need these following road feature classes:\n\nTrunk\nTrunk_link\nMotorway\nMotorway_link\n\nTherefore, we need to remove them before saving the rest of the road feature classes into our GeoPackage.\n\nOpen the Attribute Table of Clipped\n\nYour screen should look similar to the screenshot as shown below:\n\nClick on  in the menu. Your screen should look like the screenshot as shown below:\n\nTo extract out the following Roads by name,\n1) Motorway\n2) Motorway Link\n3) Trunk\n4) Trunk Link\nType in the following expression as shown in the screenshot below and click on \n\n\n\n\nYou can see from that 6830 rows are selected.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDIY\n\n\n\nClick on  to push these 8 rows to the top. Your screen should look similar to the screenshot below\n\n\n\n\nHowever, since you only want the road feature fclasses that are not these selected features, click on  to invert the selection\nYou can see from that 219057 rows are selected.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDIY\n\n\n\nUsing the steps you had learned earlier, save these selected features as a new layer as OSM_Roads into your GeoPackage\n\n\n\n\n\n3.5. – Extracting and Preparing Building, Points of Interest and Transport Layers\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDIY\n\n\n\nUsing the steps you had learned earlier, conduct data preparation and save gis_osm_buildings_a_free_1 as OSM_Buildings, gis_osm_pois_free_1, OSM_POIs and gis_osm_transport_a_free_1 as OSM_Transport into your GeoPackage Your screen should look like the screenshot as shown below\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRemember\n\n\n\nRemove all the source data from QGIS project before continue to the next section\n\n\n\n\n3.6 Downloading Singapore Residents by Planning Area / Subzone, Single Year of Age and Sex, June 2011-2020\n\n3.6.1. Importing Singapore Residents by Planning Area / Subzone, Single Year of Age and Sex, June 2011-2020 Data into QGIS\n\nDownload Singapore Residents by Planning Area / Subzone, Single Year of Age and Sex, June 2011-2020 Data from singstats.gov.sg and import it into QGIS.\n\n\n\nFrom the Layer Panel, navigate to the path of Add Delimited Text Layer as shown in the screenshot below.\n\n\n\n\nDouble-click on Add Delimited Text Layer and browse for respopagesex2011to2020 by clicking    which is at the right of File name. Your screen should look similar to the screenshot as shown below before clicking add\n\nYou will see that respopagesex2011to2020 will be added to your Layers Window as shown below\n\n\n\n\n3.6.2. Extracting 2020 Population Data \nNow, we are going to extract populations belonging to year 2020 from respopagesex2011to2020 layer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDIY\n\n\n\nUsing the steps you had learned earlier, open the Attribute Table of respopagesex2011to2020 and Select by Expression to extract our population belonging to 2020. Your screen should look like the screenshot as shown below before clicking ok\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDIY\n\n\n\nUsing the steps you had learned earlier, save the selected feature as POP2020 into your GeoPackage\n\n\n\n\n3.6.3. Calculating 2020 Population Data based on Subzones and Planning Areas using Data Manager \nNext, we are going to derive a data table that aggregates the population figure for 2000 by planning area (i.e. PA) and planning subzone (i.e SZ) by SQL in DB Manager tool of QGIS. Before getting started, you are encouraged to read this link.\n\nFrom the menu bar, select Database -> DB Manager.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDB manager dialog window appears.\n\nFrom Providers panel, click on Virtual Layers -> Project layers -> Population --- POP2020\n\nYour screen should look similar to the screenshot below. If necessary click on the Info tab.\nNotice that the beauty of DB Manager is that beside GeoPackage, Oracle Spatial PostGIS and SpatialLite, it is also able to work with Virtual Layers in the Layer panel.\nNext we are going to write the first SQL.\n\nClick on SQL Window button.\n\n\nNotice that Query (Project layers) appears.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nType the SQL below onto Query Panel.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYour screen should look similar to the screenshot as shown below\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen you are ready, click on Execute button.\n\nAfter a short while, the query results appears as shown below.\n{alt=“Graphical user interface, application” =“” Description automatically generated=“” fig-align=“center” width=“1000”}\nNow you are going to add the query into Layers Panel.\n\nClick on the check-box in front of Load as new layer.\n\nNotice that a sub-panel is added onto DB Manager dialog window.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy default, the checkbox in front of Geometry column is checked. Click on the checkbox to un-check it. This is because our data table has no geometry.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLastly, click on Load button.\n\nNotice that a QueryLayer has been added into Layers panel. Now, we are going to save it into Geopackage.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDIY\n\n\n\nUsing the steps you had learned earlier, save the selected feature as 2020POP into your GeoPackage"

Upon looking at the area on Google Street Maps, some of these residential buildings may also be hotels. Building an MRT station here would ensure that Singaporeans and tourists staying within this area will be better served by public transportation, especially since there are no nearby other MRT stations within this area, apart from Founder’s Memorial.\nSports Hub also lies within the 1000m buffer zone.

This enables more efficient travel for the students attending that school and eases traffic in the area during school drop-off and pick-up.\nThis area also now covers the bridge. Thus, travellers will be able to quickly cross it once they alight from the station."

    "text": "Catchment and Buffer Area Analysis\n\nTE22A – Founders Memorial\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCatchment Area\nBuffer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotably, there are few residential areas within the walking catchment area. The residential areas are also within the 800-1000m contour, where only a small number of people would be willing to walk. However, this MRT station is near several tourist attractions such as Founder’s Memorial and Garden by the Bay East. In doing so, people who wish to visit these areas will have their needs better accommodated to and businesses that cater to them may see increased foot traffic. Hence, tourists and tourist-facing businesses are the main beneficiaries of this station. \nThe buffer area covers the area across the bridge while the catchment area that is based on the road network cuts off before the bridge. This suggests that there is the potential for encouraging walks across the bridge that has not yet been fully tapped into yet. To do so, more direct networks could be built such that travellers would be able to cross the bridge without having to use other forms of transport such as buses or taxis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCatchment Area\nBuffer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the cycling catchment area, more residential areas are covered within it. This could encourage residents to cycle to the MRT instead of driving to their destination. Hence, this could reduce demand for private forms of transportation and encourage them to cycle to the nearby MRT stations.\nFurthermore, Promenade MRT (CC4/DT14) lies within the cycling catchment area. This means that line transfers for cyclists who need to travel to a station in the Thomson-East Coast line can do so easily without having to take the bus or private transport.\n\n\nTE23 – Tanjong Rhu\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCatchment Area\nBuffer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompared to Founder’s Memorial, the buffer area and the catchment areas are very similar to each other. This means that this area is very well-connected by the roads and walk/cycleways within the area and no new pathways need to be built to accommodate easier transit\nThe contours for 0-600m around Tanjong Rhu station exits covers a significant number of residential areas . Upon looking at the area on Google Street Maps, some of these residential buildings may also be hotels. Building an MRT station here would ensure that Singaporeans and tourists staying within this area will be better served by public transportation, especially since there are no nearby other MRT stations within this area, apart from Founder’s Memorial.\nSports Hub also lies within the 1000m buffer zone. Singapore residents who wish to exercise will be able to use public transportation to travel there.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCatchment Area\nBuffer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the cycling catchment area, more amenities are covered.
