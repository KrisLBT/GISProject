    "text": "This website provides an overview of our assessment of the accessibility and catchment areas of the Stage 4 Thomson-East Coast line MRT stations.\n\n\nWith Singapore Green Plan 2030, we want to explore how the expansion of TEL Stage 4 MRT Stations can help in making public transportation and Singapore more sustainable and greener. Presently, private transportation is preferred due to its ease and comfort. \n\n\n\nAs a result, this study aims to see how convenient TEL Stage 4 MRTS stations are for first and last mile journeys of Singaporeans and its accessibility by walking and cycling. Amenities and Population analysis will be conducted to assess its suitability to encourage Singaporeans to use public transportation. These are the steps that we will take:\n\nUse QNEAT3 to obtain the Iso-Areas and Buffer Regions for all TEL Stage 4 MRT Stations\nConduct categorization of Buildings and Points of Interests for Amenities Analysis\nCalculation of Catchment Area and Catchment Population at Subzone Level for Population Analysis\nAnalysis and Lesson Learnt from Amenities and Population Analysis\n\n\n\n\nAt the end of our study, we are able to find that all MRT stations are effective in improving Singaporeans' first and last mile journeys due to greater convenience and accessibility. On top of that, the catchment area that the population TEL serves are useful due to the lack of public transportation in these regions.\nWe found that TE27 Marine Terrace and TE26 Marine Parade are on par in being the most effective station in encouraging public transport use because the amenities in these areas are of high density usage, thus enabling these stations to reach the largest number of people as well.\nOn the other hand, TE22A Founder's Memorial's location may not be ideal for encouraging public transportation as it is the least effective in reaching out to a variety of amenities, and a large population.\nTherefore, with the effectiveness of these MRT stations, we can conclude how well first and last mile journey, through walking or cycling, has been improved.\n\n\n\n\n\nHere is the poster used at the Townhall presentation:\n\nHere are the posters belonging to the QR codes:"

    "text": "The Ministry of Transport aims to have 8 in 10 households in Singapore be within a 10 minute walk of an MRT. This was driven by the need to ensure that transit within Singapore continues to be sustainable and to reduce carbon emissions to combat climate change, which is one of the main goals highlighted in the Singapore Green Plan.\nAt present, most Singapore residents do not own a car. Instead, they use public transport such as buses and trains. This is due to the costliness in purchasing and maintaining a car. However, many people still find public transportation to be insufficient, with many wealthier people and families opting for car ownership instead. This is partially driven by the comfort and ease that driving provides to its riders.\nHowever, this contributes to our carbon emissions and makes meeting the goals set by the Green Plan difficult to achieve. This is compounded by the fact that car ownership is a negative externality. Despite the convenience it affords to its owners, it aggravates traffic and is a source of various types of pollution apart from air pollution, such as noise.\nThis points to a need to strengthen our public transportation system and to accommodate the diverse needs of Singapore residents."

This is because cycling is not a popular option amongst Singaporeans (cite), thus the numbers are low and insignificant. As a result, they will not be able to provide us with deep insights."

    "text": "Project Scope\nTo assess the accessibility and effectiveness of the MRT stations, we analysed the building types and amenities within a reasonable walking and cycling distance from the stations, both via Euclidean distance and network analysis. The distances selected for walking and cycling are 1000m and 1500m.\n1000m was selected for the walking distance based on the willingness to walk certain distances among Singaporeans. 80%, 50%, 30% and 15% of Singaporeans were willing to walk distances of 400m, 600m, 800m and 1000m from MRT Stations respectively. Hence, we opted to have intervals of 200m to reflect this. At a distance of more than 1000m, willingness dropped to around 10%, which is insignificant. Hence, it was cut off at 1000m as results from further analysis will not be able to provide us with greater insights.\n1500m was selected as the URA builds cycling racks within 1500m of an MRT station. Hence, not everyone who is willing to cycle a certain distance will be able to do so. However, 200m intervals were still chosen for the contours as it is the same intervals used for walking. This is to ensure that similar analysis grounds for both walking and cycling catchment area. The catchment area, however, used 1600m to ensure that the intervals will still be equal. More information will be provided at the introduction of Amenities Analysis later on.\nFurthermore, the population distribution was also used to calculate the potential reach to residents within the catchment areas at subzone level. More information will be provided at the introduction of Population Analysis later on as well."

As a result, we are not able to download but can only extract out the exits with reference to the MRT layout pictures on LTA website.\n\n3.3.1 Importing OSM and Opening LTA MRT Website\nWe will be guiding you through the extraction of TE22A Founders Memorial Exits as an example. Each MRT should have one layer with all its respective exits. Therefore, we need to create 7 more vector point layers on top of TE22A Founders Memorial Exits layer\n\nImport OSM layer from Browser. You will need to refer to the LTA Website as you pick the exit points out. Your screen should look similar to the screenshot as shown below.\n\nClick the LTA Website Link as given above and scroll down till you find TE22A Founders Memorial under Location of Stations. Your screen should look similar to the screenshot as shown below:\n\n\n\n\n3.3.2 Creating a New Layer for TE22A Founder’s Memorial Exits\n\nUnder Layers at the top menu bar, hover your cursor over Create Layers and click on New Shapefile Layer.\n\n\nYour screen should similar to the screenshot below:\n\n\n\n\n\nFill n the specific information as shown in the screenshot below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnder the Fields List, click on id and delete it by clicking \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, we will start naming our attributes.

Roads and streets) from both the OSM layer that we previously imported, and image from the LTA website to get as accurate of an exit point as possible. For each exit points selected, fid will be in numerical order and Exits will be in alphabetical order\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce both exits of TE22A Founders Memorial MRT Station has been marked out, click on Toggle Editing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSave the changes made by clicking Save\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYour screen should similar to the screenshot shown below\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet’s compare this to the TE22A Founders Memorial Exits from the LTA website:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet’s compare this to the TE22A Founders Memorial Exits from the LTA website\n\n\n\n\nOur GIS\nLTA Website\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can see that the points are quite similar in both images but just bear in mind that these points that you have plotted will not be accurate to that of LTA website and my screenshots due to human error. However, you do not have to worry because the results will just vary slightly.\nNow when you open your Attribute Table for TE22A Founders Memorial Exits, you can see that there will be 2 rows of data, reflecting the two exits for the MRT Station. Your screen should look similar to the screenshot as shown below\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDIY\n\n\n\nUsing the steps you had learned in previous hands-on exercise, save this layer into your GeoPackage as TE22A Founders Memorial MRT Exits\n\n\n\n\n3.3.4. Explain Outliers for TE26 Marine Parade\n\nThere will be some MRT Outline Layer from Data.gov which might not tally to the MRT Outline from LTA. Let’s take TE26 Marine Parade as an example\n\n\n\n\nOur QGIS (from data.gov)\nLTA Website\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can see that TE26 Marine Parade Outline from Data.gov is significantly shorter than that of LTA Website. However, exit points will be flushed more together than that of LTA website and the roads near the exit points will vary significantly if we want to take TE26 Marine Parade Outline from Data.gov as reference. This will significantly affect our analysis (shortest distance taken) later.\nTherefore, it would be better to take TE26 Marine Parade Outline from LTA Website as reference since it would be more accurate geographically and plot exit points out of TE26 Marine Parade MRT Outline from Data.gov. Your screen should look similar to the screenshot as shown below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.3.5. Extracting Exit Points as Individual Layers for the rest of TE24 MRT Stations\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nUsing the steps you had learned earlier, create 7 MRT Exits layers for the rest of the MRT Stations and save them into your GeoPackage as\n\nTE23 Tanjong Rhu MRT Exits – 2 Exits\nTE24 Katong Park MRT Exits – 2 Exits\nTE25 Tanjong Katong MRT Exits – 3 Exits\nTE26 Marine Parade MRT Exits – 6 Exits\nTE27 Marine Terrace MRT Exits – 6 Exits\nTE28 Siglap MRT Exits – 4 Exits\nTE29 Bayshore MRT Exits – 5 Exits\n\nYour screen should look like the screenshot as shown below\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.4 Extracting and Preparing road network layer\nI can’t emphasize enough the importance of a quality data preparation in GIS analysis. In this sub-section, you will use basic QGIS functions to perform the following data preparation tasks:\n\nselecting all roads features with the study area\nextracting appropriate road classes for the analysis\n\n\n3.4.1.

It will take awhile for QGIS to run due to large data to process but once the process is completed, a new temporary layer Clipped should appear in your Layers Menu.\nYour screen should look like the screenshot as shown below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBe Warned\n\n\n\nThe original data is in wgs84. For the purpose of network analysis, the road data must be in projected coordinates system (i.e. svy21 in Singapore).\n\n\n\n\n3.4.2. Extracting suitable road network\nSince we want to study the catchment area for walking and cycling, we do not need these following road feature classes:\n\nTrunk\nTrunk_link\nMotorway\nMotorway_link\n\nTherefore, we need to remove them before saving the rest of the road feature classes into our GeoPackage.\n\nOpen the Attribute Table of Clipped\n\nYour screen should look similar to the screenshot as shown below:\n\nClick on  in the menu. Your screen should look like the screenshot as shown below:\n\nTo extract out the following Roads by name,\n1) Motorway\n2) Motorway Link\n3) Trunk\n4) Trunk Link\nType in the following expression as shown in the screenshot below and click on \n\n\n\n\nYou can see from that 6830 rows are selected.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDIY\n\n\n\nClick on  to push these 8 rows to the top. Your screen should look similar to the screenshot below\n\n\n\n\nHowever, since you only want the road feature fclasses that are not these selected features, click on  to invert the selection\nYou can see from that 219057 rows are selected.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDIY\n\n\n\nUsing the steps you had learned earlier, save these selected features as a new layer as OSM_Roads into your GeoPackage\n\n\n\n\n\n3.5. – Extracting and Preparing Building, Points of Interest and Transport Layers\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDIY\n\n\n\nUsing the steps you had learned earlier, conduct data preparation and save gis_osm_buildings_a_free_1 as OSM_Buildings, gis_osm_pois_free_1, OSM_POIs and gis_osm_transport_a_free_1 as OSM_Transport into your GeoPackage Your screen should look like the screenshot as shown below\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRemember\n\n\n\nRemove all the source data from QGIS project before continue to the next section\n\n\n\n\n3.6 Downloading Singapore Residents by Planning Area / Subzone, Single Year of Age and Sex, June 2011-2020\n\n3.6.1.

You will learn how to delineate service area using fastest distance approach in the next sub-section.\nTo delineate service area using shortest distance approach, Iso-Area as Polygons (from Layer) function of QNEAT3 will be used.\n\nFrom QGIS’s menu bar, select Processing -> Toolbox.\n\nThe Processing Toolbox panel appears.\n\nSelect QNEATS3 -> Iso-Areas -> Iso-Area as Polygons (from Layer).\n\n\nThe Iso-Area as Polygons (From Layer) dialog window appears.\n\nFor Vector layer representing network, select Roads from the drop-down list.\nFor Start Points, select TE22A Founders Memorial from the drop-down list.\n\nNotice that both GIS layers are in projected coordinates system (i.e. EPSG:3414 which is svy21).\n\nFor Unique Point ID field, select fid from the drop-down list.\nFor Size of Iso-Area (distance or time value), type 1000.\nFor Contour Interval, type 200.\nFor Path type to calculate, select Shortest Path (distance optimization) from the drop-down list.\nFor Value for Default Speed (km/h), type in 4.44 \n\nKeep the rest of the entries as default.\nYour screen should look similar to the screenshot below.\n \nWhen you are ready to run the function,\n\nclick on the Run button.\n\nThe process involves massive computation and will take a while to complete (usually less than 5 mins in a standard 64bit machine).\nWhen the process completed, two temporary layers namely: Output Polygon and Output Interpolation will be added onto Layers panel and display on QGIS View window.\n\nThe Output Interpolation layer is a raster layer created using triangular irregular network (TIN). On the other hand, Output Polygon layer is a polygon feature showing the 5-km service area of Bukit Batok Fire Station by road network.\nThe Output Polygon is popularly known as isochrone. It is originated from Greek: iso means “the same” and chronos means “time”.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDIY\n\n\n\nUsing the steps you had learned earlier, save the Output_Polygon Layer as TE22A Contours (Walking) into your GeoPackage\n\n\n\n\n4.1.2. Data Cleaning of Walking Network Service Area of TE22A Founders Memorial\n\nTo better visualize the contours for walking distance, open the Properties Table of TE22A Contours (Walking)\n\n\n\nClick on the Symbology tab and click onGraduated\n\n\n\nFrom value, select cost_level\n\n\n\nFrom Color Ramp, click on Blues\n\nDrop number of Classes to 4\n\nFrom Mode, click on Fixed Interval\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nType 200 for Interval Size and click Classify\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYour screen should look similar to the screenshot as shown below \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom Layer Rendering, drop Opacity to 50%. Your screen should look like the screenshot as shown below before clicking OK\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith that, your walking contours can now capture the OSM layer for better analysis as it is more transparent and better categorized\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.1.3. Creating Cycling Network Service Area using Iso-Area as Polygons (from Layer) for TE22A Founders Memorial\nNow, we will be doing the same steps to delineate the network service area for cycling\nTo delineate service area using shortest distance approach, Iso-Area as Polygons (from Layer) function of QNEAT3 will be used.\n\nFrom QGIS’s menu bar, select Processing -> Toolbox.\n\nThe Processing Toolbox panel appears.\n\nSelect QNEATS3 ->Iso-Areas -> Iso-Area as Polygons (from Layer).\n\n\nThe Iso-Area as Polygons (From Layer) dialog window appears.\n\nFor Vector layer representing network, select Roads from the drop-down list.\nFor Start Points, select TE22A Founders Memorial from the drop-down list.\n\nNotice that both GIS layers are in projected coordinates system (i.e. EPSG:3414 which is svy21).\n\nFor Unique Point ID field, select fid from the drop-down list.\nFor Size of Iso-Area (distance or time value), type 1500.\n\nFor Contour Interval, type 200.\n\nFor Path type to calculate, select Shortest Path (distance optimization) from the drop-down list.\nFor Value for Default Speed (km/h), type in 10\n\nKeep the rest of the entries as default.\nYour screen should look similar to the screenshot below.\n \nWhen you are ready to run the function,\n\nclick on the Run button.\n\nThe process involves massive computation and will take a while to complete (usually less than 5 mins in a standard 64bit machine).\nWhen the process is completed, two temporary layers namely: Output Polygon and Output Interpolation will be added onto Layers panel and display on QGIS View window.\n\nThe Output Interpolation layer is a raster layer created using triangular irregular network (TIN).

It is originated from Greek: iso means “the same” and chronos means “time”.\nDIY: Using the steps you had learned earlier, save the Output_Polygon Layer as TE22A Contours (Cycling) into your GeoPackage\n\n\n4.1.4. Data Cleaning of Cycling Network Service Area of TE22A Founders Memorial\n\nTo better visualize the contours for walking distance, open the Properties Table of TE22A Contours (Walking) \nClick on the Symbology tab and click on Graduated\n\nFrom Value, select cost_level\n\nFrom Color Ramp, click on Reds\n\nDrop number of Classes to 7\n\n\n\n\nFrom Mode, click on Fixed Interval \nType 200 for Interval Size and click Classify\n\nYour screen should look similar to the screenshot as shown below\n\nFrom Layer Rendering, drop Opacity to 50%.

    "text": "5. Extracting Amenities within Catchment Areas for Amenities Analysis\n\n5.1. Extracting Buildings within Catchment Areas for Amenities Analysis for TE29 Bayshore\nTo identify the buildings that we want, we must first open the Iso-Area layer. This way, we can see what are the buildings that fall within the catchment area that requires us to recategorize. We will be guiding you through the extraction of amenities that fall within TE29 Bayshore Contours (Walking) as an example.\n\n5.1.1. Classifying Buildings\nIn the Layers panel, ensure that TE29 Bayshore Contours (Walking) layer is on\n\nOpen the Layer Properties ofOSM_Building.\nClick on Symbology tab\nAt the top of the Symbology dialog, change Type to Categorized.\n\nFor Value, select Type\n\nClick Classify. Your screen should look similar to the screenshot as shown below.\n\n\nClick OK and your screen should look similar to the screenshot as shown below\n\n\n\n5.1.2. Identifying Buildings that are NULL within the Catchment Area\nUpon closer inspection on Attribute Table for the OSM_Buildings layer, we find that many have null Type values. Since the Type is the property that will be able to differentiate the nature of the buildings, we will need to fix this. Therefore, we need to perform recategorizing of the building types.\n\nIn the Layers panel, right click on OSM_Buildings and open its Attributes Table. \nUse Select Features by Area or Select Feature(s)  and click on one of the buildings in red in the screenshot as shown below. (Your buildings may have a different color combination)\n\n\n\n\nWe see that the Type is null for these buildings.\n\n\nNow, we will need to use external software, Google Maps or Maps, to identify our building type with existing visual data and change it in our Attributes Table accordingly.\n\nClick on the Toggle Editing Mode icon  in the Attributes Table to allow for editing function. \n\n\n\n5.1.3 Data Cleaning for NULL Buildings within the Catchment Area\nBelow shows a table of how and why we recategorize NULL buildings into the correct building types that we use in our analysis.\n\n\n\nBuildings\nType\nExamples\nJustification\n\n\n\n\nNursing care homes\n“residential”\nEcon Nursing Home Services (1987) Ptd Ltd\nRefer to Appendix A Figure 1.\nAccording to the Urban Redevelopment Authority (2019), nursing care homes are either zoned as “Civic and Community Institution’’ or”Residential/Institution” in the Master Plan. However, since elderly live in these homes, we decided to classify them as “residential”.\n\n\n“apartments” /  “condominium” / “hall”\n“residential”\nRefer to Appendix A Figure 2.\nOur term “residential” would refer to residential buildings that are not low rise (which are only 4 or less storeys high). These buildings will then be classified as buildings that have a large population density, and they approximately hold the same number of residents as Housing & Development Board (HDB) buildings. HDB buildings will be classified as “residential” as well.\n\n\nLanded houses / terrace houses\n“Low rise residential”\nRefer to Appendix A Figure 3.\nThese building types are low rise, and they only serve as residential blocks for a small number of people. This will allow us to estimate the amount of people that are affected in this building type during our analysis.\n\n\n“semidetached_house” / “detached” / “bungalow” / “house”\n“Low rise residential”\nRefer to Appendix A Figure 4.\nThis is for standardisation and data cleaning as they all serve to hold a small number of people.\n\n\nRepair shops / Servicing shops / Stand-alone Small Businesses /\n“business”\nRefer to Appendix A Figure 5.\nThese are small businesses that operate for profit making. We follow the business types according to the URA (2022) classification guideline.\n\n\n“office” / “shop”\n“business”\nRefer to Appendix A Figure 6.\n“office” buildings would be considered large corporate businesses. We classify them together with other small businesses because we want to generalise how business workers will be affected by the MRT stations when travelling to or from work.\n“shop” are recategorized to “business” because they are a subset of a business. “shop” have the same nature as stand-alone small businesses and offices since they are buildings for people to work in.\n\n\nReligious buildings /\n“chapel” / “church” / “mosque” / “religion” / “religious” / “shrine” / “temple”\n“Place of worship”\nRefer to Appendix A Figure 7.\nWe recategorize to make the classification cleaner and neater by having all religious forms of activity classified under 1 label. We use this term according to URA’s as they term it “place of worship” as well.\n\n\nCommunity Centres / Police Station / Town Hall\n“C&CI”\nRefer to Appendix A Figure 8.\nAccording to the URA, these building types are commonly termed “Civic and Community Institution”, “C&CI” in short. Therefore, we follow these guidelines when classifying and giving these buildings a term.\n\n\n“civic” / “clubhouse” / “club house” / “fire_station” / “government” / “public” / “sports_centre” / “sports_hall” / “stadium”\n“C&CI”\nRefer to Appendix A Figure 9.\n\n\n\n“garage” / “garages”\n“C&CI”\n-\nThis is for standardization and data cleaning.\n\n\nStand-alone Restaurants / Cafe\n“food”\nRefer to Appendix A Figure 10.\nSince these buildings are stand-alone, they only serve one purpose which is providing food service. We can distinguish these food shops from “business” to show how food places, food choices, and food availability may be affected by residents in catchment areas due to the MRT.\n\n\nShophouses\n“commercial”\nRefer to Appendix A Figure 11.\nThese shophouses often encompass many different types of uses such as eateries, convenience stores, salons, houses, small company enterprises, and many more. Hence, it is unfeasible and will be inaccurate to distinctively mark out every unit into a certain building type. Furthermore, this will complicate the classification process and create too many classes that will be too specific. Hence, we classify them as “commercial” to show that these buildings have many different uses.\n\n\n“toilets”\n“toilet”\n-\nThis is for standardization and data cleaning.\n\n\nBuilding structures that do not appear on Google Maps / Building structures that cannot be classified by eye\n“unclassified”\nRefer to Appendix A Figure 12.\nThese do not have a label on Google. Hence, we are not able to identify its specific use and it is better not to assume of the building use. Furthermore, their use may differ at different times of the year. Therefore, we do not know the true purpose of these building types.\n\n\nPrimary schools / Secondary schools / Preschools / School organizations\n“school”\nRefer to Appendix A Figure 13.\nThese building types are distinctively classified as “school”.\n\n\n“kindergarten”\n“school”\n-\nThis is for standardization and data cleaning.\n\n\nPetrol stations\n“transport facilities”\nRefer to Appendix A Figure 14.\nAccording to the URA (2019), these buildings are deemed as “transport facilities”.\n\n\n\n\nAfter editing, click on Toggle Editing Mode icon. A pop-up window will appear as shown below\n\n\n\n\nClick on Save when the prompt appears.\n\n\n\n5.1.4 Extracting all Buildings in Catchment Area\nSince we want to analyze the types of buildings that fall under TE29 Bayshore Contours (Walking), we need to extract them out. \n\nIn the Attributes Toolbar, click on Select by Location \n\nThe Select by Location dialog windows appear.\n\nFrom Select features from, select OSM_Buildings \nTick the checkbox in front of Intersect under the Where he Features \nFrom By Comparing to the Features from, select TE29 Bayshore Contours (Walking). Your screen should look similar to the screenshot below.\n\n\n\n\nClick Run. Your screen should look similar to the screenshot as shown below.\n\n\n\nHowever, we see that some buildings within the catchment area are not selected because the contour does not cover those parts. However, all buildings directly beside would be reachable within the Iso-Area of 1 km for walking and 1.5 km for cycling. Hence, we need to make sure that these buildings are also selected.\n\nIn the Attributes Toolbar, click on Select Feature(s)\n\nIn your keyboard, press on the Shift key as you click on the additional buildings that are directly beside the Catchment Areas on your QGIS.\n\nNow, we need to save this to our GeoPackage.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDIY\n\n\n\nUsing the steps you had learned earlier, save these selected features as a new layer as TE29_ buildings_walking into your GeoPackage. Your screen should look similar to the screenshot as show below before clicking OK\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom your Layers Menu, you can see a new layer TE29_ buildings_walking is created\n\nHowever, since the buildings are now uncategorized, you must categorize them again. Since the null building types are updated in TE29_ buildings_walking, no further data cleaning is required, and categorizing is enough.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDIY\n\n\n\nUsing the steps you had learned earlier, categorize TE29_ buildings_walking based on their fclass under Symbology in Layer Properties\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDIY\n\n\n\nUsing the steps you had learned earlier, repeat all the steps in section 1.6 for all walking and building contours for all TEL 4 Stage 4 MRT Stations into your GeoPackage\n\n\n\n\n\n5.2 Extracting Points of Interests within Catchment Areas for Amenities Analysis for TE29 Bayshore\nWe also want to analyze the types of POIs that will be affected by the TEL Stage 4 MRT stations. Hence, we also need to get the POIs that fall within the catchment area for both walking and cycling. The steps to do so are also the same as for Buildings.\n\n5.2.1. Extracting all Points of Interest in Catchment Area\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDIY\n\n\n\nUsing the steps you had learned earlier, extract all Points of Interests that falls under TE29 Bayshore Contours (Walking) and save these selected features as a new layer as TE29_pois_walking into your GeoPackage.

Creating Layouts for Amenities Analysis\nTo analyze what are the buildings and POIs within the catchment area that are affected by the MRT stations, other than categorizing them into their building types and POI class, we want to get the count of these categories. This way, we can get deeper insights as to who exactly are those that are affected by the MRT, and how many of these people are affected. We will do so by making use of the bar graph plot functionality in QGIS to plot the count of these amenities.

    "text": "8. Creating Choropleth Maps for Catchment Population for Population Analysis\n\n8.1. Creating Common Attribute\nBefore you merge 2020POP and MP19_Subzone together, you need to have a common attribute. By opening Attribute Table of 2020POP, you will see the following columns\n\nBy opening Attribute Table of MP19_Subzone, you will see the following columns as well\n\nHowever, you see that it is quite messy, so you need to filter out columns that do not provide much information to you.\n\nClick on Organize Columns  and uncheck these following columns before clicking OK\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou will see that your Attribute Table for MP19_Subzone is so much cleaner now\n\nIf you look at both Attribute Tables carefully, you will realize that the column ‘SZ’ in 2020POP is in lower case of column ‘SUBZONE_N’ in MP19_Subzone. Therefore, we need to use subzone names to merge both 2020POP and MP19_Subzone together.\n\nGo to 2020POP’s Attribute Table and select Open Field Calculator at the top. A pop-up window will appear as shown below\n\nAs we aim to capitalize the string data in ‘SZ’ column, fill in the Output Field Name and the Output Field Type as shown below.\n\nType the following code as shown below\n\n\nThe preview will show you what the new string will be in the new column ‘SUBZONE’\n\nClick OK and you will see that a new column ‘SUBZONE’ is added to your 2020POP’s Attribute Table\n\n\nHowever, the table will be in edit format, so you need to save the changes that you had made.\n\nClick on  (top left of your screen). A pop-up will appear as shown below and click Save\n\n\n\n\n8.2. Performing Relational Join Between MP19_Subzone and 2020POP layers\nNow you are ready to perform relational join between the MP19_Subzone layer and the 2020POP layer. To join the Attribute Table of a geospatial data and an aspatial Attribute Table, we need to identify the common key or popularly known as Unique Identifier between these two data sets with we had prepared earlier. In this case, it is the Subzone Names (‘SUBZONE’ and ‘SUBZONE_N’)\n\nYou are ready to join both tables now.\n\nFrom the Layers panel, double-click on MP19_Subzone layer.\n\nThe Layer Properties dialog window appears.\n\nFrom the Tab menu, click on the Joins tab.\n\nYour screen should look similar to the screenshot below.\n\n\nClick on Add New Join icon \n\nThe Add Vector Join dialog window appears.\n\nFor Join Layer, select 2020POP from the drop-down list.\nFor Join field, select SUBZONE from the drop-down list.\nFor Target field, select SUBZONE_N from the drop-down list.\n\nClick on OK button to perform the relational join.\n\nYou will return to the Layer Properties dialog window.\nNotice that a relational joined between 2020POP Attribute Table and the Attribute Table of MP19_Subzone has been created.\n\nAt the Layer Properties dialog window, click on the OK button.\n\nStrange, it seems that nothing had happened!\n\nAt the Layers panel, right click on MP19_Subzone layer and select open Attribute Table from the context menu.\n\nYou will notice that the table now contains additional fields from 2020POP attribute layer.\n\nRemember that this joint is temporary. It is not part of the Attribute Table of MP19_Subzone layer but is just linked dynamically to the 2020POP layer. If you want to permanently join the attributes, you must save it as a new layer.\n\nTo double check if both attribute tables are joined properly, click on \n\nIf the rows are not joined properly, values belonging to 2020POP in Attribute Table of MP19_Subzone will reflect as NULL. Therefore, we will have to find NULL values by using the following expression as shown below\n\nType the following code as shown in the screenshot below\n\nClick on Select Features \n\nYou can tell that from  that 0 row is selected which means that both attributes’ tables are joined properly\n\n\n8.3. Creating Choropleth Map for Subzone Population\nIn this section, you will learn how to create a choropleth map showing the distribution of 2020 population in 2020POP by MP19_Subzone.\nYou are ready to prepare the choropleth now.\n\nFrom the Layers panel, double-click on MP19_Subzone layer.\n\nThe Layer Properties dialog window appears.\n\nClick on Symbology tab.\nAt Symbol selection drop-down list, select Graduated from the drop-down list.\nFor Value, select 2020POP_total_pop from the drop-down list.\nFor Classes, keep it as 5.\nFor Color Ramp, choose Blues or any colour of your choice from the drop-down list.\nFor Mode, choose Natural Breaks (Jenks) from the drop-down list. \nClick on Classify button.\n\nYour screen should look similar to the figure below.\n\nYou can review the statistical distribution of the classification in histogram.\n\nClick on the Histogram tab.\nClick on Load values button.\n\nYour screen should look similar to the figure below.\n\nThis feature is very useful for casual data analysts because the histogram helps us to understand the differences of each classification method.\n\nClick on Classes tab.\nClick on Apply button.\nClick on the OK button.\n\nYour screen should look similar to the figure below.\n\n\n\n8.4. Calculating Catchment Population\nWe will be guiding you through the calculation of Catchment Population for TE27 Marine Terrace Contours (Walking) as an example.\n\n8.4.1. Creating a ‘Subzone_Area’ column for MP19_Subzone\nTo calculate the Catchment Population, we need to find out the ratio of Subzone Catchment Area to its Subzone Area for all subzones that falls within each contour line first. \nDIY: Using the steps that you learned earlier, open Attribute Table of MP19_Subzone and click on Open Field Calculator. Your screen should look similar to the screenshot as shown below\n\nWe want to create a new column ‘Subzone_Area’ for each subzone area.\n\nType the following code as shown in the screenshot below before clicking OK\n\n\nYou will see that a new column ‘Subzone_Area’ is now created in the Attribute Table of MP19_Subzone\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDIY\n\n\n\nUsing the steps that you learnt earlier, save the changes made and filter out unnecessary columns in the Attribute Table of MP19_Subzone. Your screen should look similar to the screenshot as shown below.\n\n\n\n\n\n8.4.2. Extracting Polygons\n\nFrom Vector on the Menu, hover your cursor over Geoprocessing Tools and click on Union\n\nYour screen should look similar to the screenshot as shown below\n\nSelect the correct layers for your Input and Overlay layers as shown in the screenshot below\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDIY\n\n\n\nWith the steps that you learnt earlier, for better performance, select Do Not Filter (Better Performance) from under Invalid feature filtering for both input and overlap layers before clicking Run. Your screen should look like the screenshot as shown below. \n\n\nYou can see that a temporary layer Union is created in your layer menu.\n\nLet’s analyze the Attribute Table of this Temporary layer Union. \nDIY: With the steps that you learnt earlier, open the Attribute Table of Union. Your screen should look similar to the screenshot as shown below\n\nYou can see that it is very messy, thus filtering of column is required.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDIY\n\n\n\nWith the steps that you learnt earlier, filter out unnecessary columns and leave those columns checked as shown in the screenshot below. Your screen should look similar to the screenshot as shown below.\n\n\n\nSince you only need the rows for those in the catchment polygon layers, you need to do further data filtering.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDIY\n\n\n\nUsing the steps that you learnt earlier, click on Select by Expression and type in the following code as shown below before clicking Select Features\n\n\n\nYou can see from  that 25 rows are selected based on the condition that we had set. Now you want to save these 25 rows as TE27 Population (Walking) into your GeoPackage. However, you need to ensure that these 25 rows have a unique fid first.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDIY\n\n\n\nUsing the steps that you learnt earlier, manually change all the fid of the selected rows starting from 1 to 25 and save it. Your screen should look similar to the screenshot as shown below.\n\n\n\nOnce that is done, you can now save the selected feature into your GeoPackage now\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDIY\n\n\n\nUsing the steps that you learnt earlier, save the selected features as a layer as TE27 Population (Walking) into your GeoPackage\n\n\n\nYou can see that a permanent layer called TE27 Population (Walking) is now created in your Layer menu as shown below.\n\n\n\n8.4.3. Creating a ‘Catchment_ Subzone_Area’ Column\nTo calculate the Catchment Subzone Area, we need to open the Attribute Table for TE27 Population (Walking). \n\n\n\n\n\n\nDIY\n\n\n\nUsing the steps that you learnt earlier, open the Attribute Table for TE27 Population (Walking). Your screen should look similar to the screenshot as shown below.\n\n\n\nYou can still see that the Attribute Table contains a lot of unnecessary columns, thus we need to conduct filtering \n\n\n\n\n\n\nDIY\n\n\n\nUsing the steps that you learnt earlier, filter out unnecessary columns and leave those columns as shown below. Your screen should look similar to the screenshot as shown below\n\n\n\nNow we need to find out the area of the Catchment Subzone Area using Open Field Calculator\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDIY\n\n\n\nUsing the steps that you learnt earlier, create a new column for Catchment_Area using the following code as shown in the screenshot below before clicking OK\n\n\n\nYour Attribute Table should reflect the additional ‘Catchment_Area’ created as shown in the screenshot below. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDIY\n\n\n\nUsing the steps that you learnt earlier, save the changes made to the Attribute Table of TE27 Population (Walking)\n\n\n\n\n8.4.4. Creating a ‘Ratio’ Column for TE27 Population (Walking)\nAssuming that Population is equally distributed across the subzone area, you need to calculate the percentage of Catchment Area to respective Subzone Area. Since now you have both Catchment Subzone Area and Subzone Area, this is now possible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDIY\n\n\n\nUsing the steps that you learnt earlier, create a new column ‘Ratio’ using the Open Field Calculator in the Attribute Table and type in the following code as shown below before clicking OK\n\n\n\nYour Attribute Table should reflect the additional ‘Ratio’ created as shown in the screenshot below. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDIY\n\n\n\nUsing the steps that you learnt earlier, save the changes made to the Attribute Table of TE27 Population (Walking)\n\n\n\n\n8.4.5. Creating a ‘Catchment_Population’ Column\nSince now we have the ratio, we will calculate Catchment Population by multiplying the Subzone Population and respective ratio per subzone and contour. The assumption made above still holds.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDIY\n\n\n\nUsing the steps that you learnt earlier, create a new column ‘Catchment_Population’ using the Open Field Calculator in the Attribute Table and type in the following code as shown below before clicking OK\n\n\n\nYour Attribute Table should reflect the additional ‘Catchment_Population’ created as shown in the screenshot below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDIY\n\n\n\nUsing the steps that you learnt earlier, save the changes made to the Attribute Table of TE27 Population (Walking)\n\n\n\n\n\n8.5. Creating a Choropleth Map for Catchment Population\nTo better present the data, it would be better to represent the Catchment Population in the form of a Choropleth Map with OSM and MP19_Subzone Layers\n\n8.5.1. Creating a Choropleth Map for Catchment Population\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDIY\n\n\n\nUsing the steps that you learnt earlier, open the Layer Properties for TE27 Population (Walking) and click on the Symbology tab.\n\n\nOur value for Catchment Population Choropleth Map would be ‘Catchment_Population’. But wait! You can see from the screenshot below that this column is not present anywhere in the list of values as shown in the screenshot below.\n\nIs there any way to overcome this? Of course!\n\nClick on the  on the right side of Symbol. A pop-up should appear as shown in the screenshot below.\n\n\n\n\nType in the following code as shown below before clicking OK\n\n\nNow you can see that ‘Catchment_Population’ is reflected as the value as shown in the screenshot below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDIY\n\n\n\nUsing the steps that you learnt earlier, generate a Choropleth Map for Catchment Population. Your Symbology screen should look similar to the screenshot as shown below before clicking OK\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, you can see that a Choropleth Map is generated based on TE27 Contours (Walking)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8.5.1. Making a Transparent Fill for MP19_Subzone Layer\nHowever, this isn’t visibly pleasing. If we can show the division of MP19_Subzone and the OSM layer, it can provide us with more information for better analysis. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nDIY\n\n\n\nUsing the steps that you learnt earlier, open the Symbology tab for MP19_Subzone layer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick on Simple Fill under Fill. Your screen should look similar to the screenshot as shown below.\n\nSelect Transparent Fill under Fill color\n\nIncrease Stroke Width to 1 before clicking OK\n\n\nNow you can see from your main screen, \n\nEach Subzone is divided distinctly \nEach part of the Contour that falls in their respective Subzone\nNearby amenities (Transport, POIs and Buildings) within the Contours\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDIY\n\n\n\nUsing the steps that you learnt earlier, generate Choropleth Maps for both Walking and Cycling Contours for the rest of the TEL Stage 4 MRT Stations."

    "text": "As Singapore moves towards SG Green Plan 2030, one of their goals is to achieve 75% mass public transport (i.e. rail and bus) peak-period modal share. By expanding the current MRT station network, they hope to improve Singaporeans' first and last mile journeys to encourage more Singaporeans to take them. With this goal in mind, we will conduct Amenities Analysis for Catchment Areas. It will consist of the following:\n\nAnalysis of the Amenities Distribution within Catchment Areas\n\nFirstly, our purpose of analysis is to explore the types of Amenities captured at each contour level for each TEL Stage 4 MRT Stations based on the current road network present and analyse its impact on first and last mile journeys for Singaporeans\nWe also assume that buffers are the optimum catchment areas for all TEL Stage 4 MRT Stations. With reference to Walking and Cycling Buffers, we also hope to analyse the distribution of the contour intervals to provide improvements to existing road network systems to increase the reach of Catchment Areas.\n\nComparison of Catchment Areas to respective Buffers \nAnalysis of Contour Interval Distribution of Catchment Areas \n\nAssumptions made are:\n\nBuffers are the most optimum catchment areas for all TEL Stage 4 MRT Stations\n\n\n\n\nA distance of 1000m will be used for maximum Walking Iso-Area and Buffer. This is because the proportion of Singaporeans who are willing to walk to an MRT station from a distance of more than 1000m from MRT Station, drops to less than 1/10. This proportion is insignificant and lesser than the proportion at 1000m which is 10% which is considered to be small. As a result, further analysis of Singaporeans' willingness to walk from more than 1000m will not be able to provide us with deep insights for analysis, thus we will stop at 1000m for this project.\nThe study also shows the proportion of Singaporeans who are willing to walk to MRT Station every 200m till the 1000m mark. As a result, we will be using 200m as our Walking Iso-Area Interval and these proportion figures in our calculation for population analysis later.\n\n\n\nWe initially hope to use a distance of 1500m for maximum Cycling Iso-Area and Buffer. This is because URA adds 250-800 bicycle racks to accommodate leisure cyclists that fall within a radius of 1500m from MRT Stations. As a result, following URA's urban planning methodology in our project would aid us greatly in our analysis.\nIn order to conduct similar analysis for both our Walking and Cycling Catchment, we will also be using 200m as Cycling Iso-Area Interval in our QGIS. However, this will push our maximum Cycling Iso-Area and Buffer to 1600m instead, which is a multiple of 200m, as the QGIS is not able to generate an additional internal of 100m for our last Cycling Iso-Area Polygon Layer."

    "section": "2. Amenities Analysis",
    "text": "2. Amenities Analysis\n\n2.1. TE22A – Founders Memorial\n\n2.1.1. Catchment Amenities Distribution and Buffer (Walking)\n\n\n\nWalking Catchment and Buffer\n\n\nNotably, there are few residential areas within the walking catchment area. The residential areas are also within the 800-1000m contour, where only a small number of people would be willing to walk. However, this MRT station is near several tourist attractions such as Founder's Memorial, Garden by the Bay East and Marina Bay Golf Course. In doing so, people who wish to visit these areas will have their needs better accommodated to and businesses that cater to them may see increased foot traffic. Hence, tourists and tourist-facing businesses are the main beneficiaries of this station. This would mean that TE22A will not be very useful for first mile journeys, but will be catered more for last mile journeys for people to get to these tourist spots and recreational activities.\nThe buffer area covers the area across the bridge while the catchment area that is based on the road network cuts off before the bridge. This suggests that there is the potential for encouraging walks across the bridge that has not yet been fully tapped into yet. To do so, more direct networks could be built such that travellers would be able to cross the bridge without having to use other forms of transport such as buses or taxis. \nFrom the layout, it can also be seen that walking contour intervals are more clustered together towards the centre of the map. It signifies that those areas are inaccessible based on the existing road network systems. However, since the area belongs to Marina Bay Golf Course, it is a private property which explains its inaccessibility.\n\n\n2.1.2. Catchment Amenities Distribution and Buffer (Cycling)\n\n\n\nCycling Catchment and Buffer\n\n\nFor the cycling catchment area, more residential areas are covered within it. This could encourage residents to cycle to the MRT instead of driving to their destination. Hence, this could reduce demand for private forms of transportation and encourage them to cycle to the nearby MRT stations. \nPromenade MRT (CC4/DT14) lies outside the cycling catchment area, but within the cycling buffer area. This means that if a better road network is available, line transfers for people who need to travel to a station in the TEL from the Circle line can do so easily without having to take the bus or private transport. This will significantly improve first and last mile journeys using public transport for those who are willing to cycle since the reach of TE22A has expanded to those that start or end their journey anywhere along the Thomson-East Coast line or the Circle line.\nFrom the layout, it can also be seen that cycling contour intervals are more clustered together towards the centre of the map. It signifies that those areas are inaccessible based on the existing road network systems. However, since the area belongs to Marina Bay Golf Course, it is a private property which explains its inaccessibility.\n\n\n\n2.2. TE23 – Tanjong Rhu\n\n2.2.1. Catchment Amenities Distribution and Buffer (Walking)\n\n\n\nWalking Catchment and Buffer\n\n\nThere are more buildings covered by Tanjong Rhu catchment area as compared to Founder's Memorial catchment area. Some of which lie in both catchment areas. These buildings in the overlapping catchment areas include residential and commercial buildings. Therefore, residents and people who frequent these commercial buildings get to benefit from the convenience of having two accessible MRT stations, improving both first and last mile journeys. Upon looking at the area on Google Street Maps, some buildings in the catchment area may also be hotels. Building an MRT station here would ensure that Singaporeans and tourists staying within this area will be better served by public transportation, especially since there are no nearby other MRT stations within this area, apart from Founder's Memorial.\nSports Hub also lies within the 1000m buffer zone. Singapore residents who wish to exercise will be able to use public transportation to travel there. Although the Sports Hub may be a 1000m walk from TE23, people who visit the Sports Hub are most likely to be ready to engage in some form of exercise. Hence, the willingness to walk 1000m to their destination will likely be greater than 15%. Thus, TE23 will serve as a sustainable and motivational form of transportation for active citizens travelling to the Sports Hub.\nCompared to TE22A Founder's Memorial, the walking contour intervals for TE23 Tanjong Rhu is more spaced out. This means that the walking catchment area is more well-connected by the roads within the area. No new pathways need to be built to accommodate easier transit. Despite more clustered contour intervals near East Coast Part Zone A, it is remembered that its nearby land belongs to Marina Bay Golf Course, which is a private property, explaining its inaccessibility.\n\n\n2.2.2. Catchment Amenities Distribution and Buffer (Cycling)\n\n\n\nCycling Catchment and Buffer\n\n\nIn the cycling catchment area, more amenities are covered. The map shows more types of services that Singaporeans can access at the convenience of cycling. Within this area, a school - specifically Dunman High - is accessible within a 1500m distance of the MRT station. This enables a variety of last mile journeys for students attending Dunman High as they are able to cycle to school easily, furthermore easing road traffic in the area during drop-off and pick-up periods.\nCompared to TE22A Founder's Memorial, the cycling contour intervals for TE23 Tanjong Rhu is more spaced out. This means that the cycling catchment area is more well-connected by the roads within the area. No new pathways need to be built to accommodate easier transit. Despite more clustered contour intervals near East Coast Part Zone A, it is remembered that its nearby land belongs to Marina Bay Golf Course, which is a private property, explaining its inaccessibility.\n\n\n\n2.3. TE24 – Katong Park\n\n2.3.1. Catchment Amenities Distribution and Buffer (Walking)\n\n\n\nWalking Catchment and Buffer\n\n\nThe walking catchment area covers a significant number of residential areas for both low rise and high rise buildings, including hotels. The station will, thus, be able to cater to a large and diverse set of people who may need to travel to tourist attractions or to commercial buildings. Therefore, improving first mile journey can be addressed by TE24 since the station is largely centred around living land use. \nDunman High is also 400-600m away (5-7 minutes’ walk) from TE24, making it more convenient for students to alight here than at Mountbatten, the current nearest MRT which is a 15 minutes’ walk. Since most students will travel with public transportation, this also improves last mile journey for students as they have a much more convenient route to travel to school after alighting from an MRT station.\nThe walking contour intervals for TE24 Katong Park are evenly distributed. This means that the catchment area is more well-connected by the roads within the area. No new pathways need to be built to accommodate easier transit. Furthermore, since the walking catchment area nearly covers the buffer, it also shows that the existing road network is almost at optimum and location is ideal for Singaporeans to walk TE24 Katong Park with ease.\n\n\n2.3.2. Catchment Amenities Distribution and Buffer (Cycling)\n\n\n\nCycling Catchment and Buffer\n\n\nFor the cycling catchment area, more amenities are covered and other schools - Tanjong Katong Girls' School and Tanjong Katong Secondary School - also lie within this area. Should students opt for cycling, this station has the potential to greatly ease traffic during drop-off and pick-up periods. \nA larger number of low rise residential areas are also covered within this region. This could mean that a significant number of people will no longer need to use their cars to get to different areas of Singapore as they may easily access public transport by cycling to TE24. This also improves the first mile journey for public transport in this area, encouraging these residents to make the choice of taking public transport instead of using their private vehicles. Additionally, Mountbatten MRT (CC7) also lies within this contour range of 1200-1400m. This will significantly improve the travelling journey for those who wish to travel from the North-Western of the Circle line to the Eastern side of TEL. \nThe cycling contour intervals for TE24 Katong Park are also evenly distributed. This means that the cycling catchment area is more well-connected by the roads within the area. No new pathways need to be built to accommodate easier transit. Furthermore, since the cycling catchment area nearly covers the buffer, it also shows that the existing road network is almost at optimum and location is ideal for Singaporeans to cycle TE24 Katong Park with ease.\n\n\n\n2.4. TE25 – Tanjong Katong\n\n2.4.1. Catchment Amenities Distribution and Buffer (Walking)\n\n\n\nWalking Catchment and Buffer\n\n\nThe walking catchment area covers a significant number of residential buildings - both high rise and low rise, including hotels and condominiums. This could suggest that the TEL would need to be able to accommodate a diverse pool of needs, ranging from tourists and residents. Importantly, the majority of them are low rise residential areas, where people are generally car owners. Hence, by making public transport more accessible to these residents, the ease of first mile journey using public transport will highly encourage them to use their cars less frequently and opt to use the train when travelling instead.\nThe discrepancy between the buffer area and the area covered by the road network is mostly due to the low rise residential buildings. This suggests that providing a more convenient first mile journey for these residents could be achievable if there are better road networks in this area. With the current road networks, it could have contributed to the residents' use of private vehicles to get to their destination, even if they are of a short distance. Therefore, the enhancement for first mile journey could have been benefited by a larger population.\nSimilarly to TE24 Katong Park, the walking contour intervals for TE25 Tanjong Katong are also evenly distributed. This means that the walking catchment area is more well-connected by the roads within the area.The Singapore Government can explore improving the road network systems to expand the walking catchment area upwards towards the buffer limit. However, since the walking catchment area covers a significant part of the buffer, it shows that the existing road network is almost at optimum and location is ideal for Singaporeans for Singaporeans to walk to TE25 Tanjong Katong with ease.\n\n\n2.4.2. Catchment Amenities Distribution and Buffer (Cycling)\n\n\n\nCycling Catchment and Buffer\n\n\nFor the cycling catchment area, even more amenities are covered. The map shows more types of services that Singaporeans can access at the convenience of cycling. The East of this catchment area shows many points of interest (POIs) are located, suggesting that last mile journeys to these POIs are improved by the presence of TE25. Since these POIs are easily accessible by cyclists throughout this region, this could boost interest in smaller businesses within this area. Furthermore, several schools lie within this catchment area again, serving students in the Tanjong Katong region to alternative means to go to school, reducing traffic in the region once more.\n\n\nSimilarly to TE24 Katong Park, the cycling contour intervals for TE25 Tanjong Katong are also evenly distributed. This means that the cycling catchment area is more well-connected by the roads within the area.The Singapore Government can explore improving the road network systems to expand the cycling catchment area upwards towards the buffer limit. However, since the cycling catchment area covers a significant part of the buffer, it shows that the existing road network is almost at optimum and location is ideal for Singaporeans to cycle to TE25 Tanjong Katong with ease.\n\n\n\n2.5. TE26 – Marine Parade\n\n2.5.1. Catchment Amenities Distribution and Buffer (Walking)\n\n\n\nWalking Catchment and Buffer\n\n\nWithin the 0-400m contour of the Iso-Area, most buildings are residential and retail buildings. This shows that the MRT station will be very useful in encouraging a diverse set of people to take public transportation as it can reach out to a large number of people who have a high willingness to walk to an MRT station to travel. The MRT will be located directly beside a few large retail buildings, with one of its exits lying inside one retail building to provide easy access to the station through the mall. This suggests that the intended main beneficiaries of such a station would be people who work in the commercial buildings within the region. Thus, the first mile and last mile journeys for residents and workers in this region will be significantly improved.\nWe can also see that TE26 will have 6 exits that are distributed throughout a relatively large area, where 3 of them lie outside the MRT station itself. This provides people with a comfortable and convenient way to access TE26 through an underground pass at a further distance from the MRT station itself, further reducing the barriers to accessibility of using public transport. \nSimilarly to TE25 Tanjong Katong, the walking contour intervals for TE26 Marine Parade are also relatively distributed. This means that the walking catchment area is more well-connected by the roads within the area. Since the walking catchment area covers a significant part of the buffer, it shows that the existing road network is almost at optimum and  location is ideal for Singaporeans to walk to TE26 Marine Parade with ease.\n\n\n2.5.2. Catchment Amenities Distribution and Buffer (Cycling)\n\n\n\nCycling Catchment and Buffer\n\n\nFor the cycling catchment area, we see that there are mostly more residential and low rise residentials covered by approximately 500 and 1500 respectively, showing that people who will be willing to cycle to an MRT as their first mile journey mode are mostly residents as well. Of particular interest is the high number of low rise residentials - many of whom are car owners. This could encourage them to switch away from driving and to more sustainable forms of transport. With a large number of POIs lying within this area, such as cafes and shops, building an MRT station in this area could significantly boost many businesses due to increased footfall and more efficient travel, driving up economic activities in Marine Parade. Future land use plans may then account for this volume of economic activity and suggest appropriate land use.\nAdditionally, the cycling catchment for TE26 reaches approximately 4300 (high rise) residential, low rise residential and commercial buildings, the largest out of all other stage 4 TEL MRT stations, the presence of 6 exits to provide greater convenience is justifiable.\nSimilarly to TE25 Tanjong Katong, the cycling contour intervals for TE26 Marine Parade are also relatively distributed. This means that the cycling catchment area is more well-connected by the roads within the area. Since the cycling catchment area covers a significant part of the buffer, it shows that the existing road network is almost at optimum and  location is ideal for Singaporeans to cycle to TE26 Marine Parade with ease.\n\n\n\n2.6. TE27 – Marine Terrace\n\n2.6.1. Catchment Amenities Distribution and Buffer (Walking)\n\n\n\nWalking Catchment and Buffer\n\n\nThe walking catchment area covers many residential buildings, especially that of high rise buildings located within 0-600m of the MRT station. This means that there will be a high percentage of people who will walk to the MRT despite a 50% willingness at a distance of 600m since high rise residential buildings are home to a large number of people. This will mean that first mile journey will improve for a large number of people. Within 0-400m of this catchment area also includes 5 schools. Hence, this MRT will provide students more options and convenience to travel, improving last mile journey for them. With the short last mile journey distance for students, it could also substantially reduce traffic congestion, especially during drop-off periods, as students may opt to use the MRT instead of private vehicles. As many buildings within this catchment area are of high density functions, TE27 proves to be a very useful station for many people to use as their travelling mode.\nAs shown by the buffer area, more low rise residential buildings would be covered if there were better road networks. This could suggest that the number of roads inside these low rise residential neighbourhoods is insufficient for walking. This will hence cause people to use private vehicles to travel instead. Therefore, in order to encourage these residents to switch to public transport, better road networks can be implemented.\n\n\n2.6.2. Catchment Amenities Distribution and Buffer (Cycling)\n\n\n\nCycling Catchment and Buffer\n\n\nFor the cycling catchment area, it reaches more low rise residential buildings. In addition to people living within 1km of TE27, those who are willing to cycle to the MRT station will include those that stay in landed properties. Hence, this shows that having a better road network is critical in encouraging low rise residential buildings residents to take non-private forms of transport such as cycling.\nNonetheless, the cycling contour intervals for TE27 Marine Terrace are also relatively well-distributed as that in TE26 Marine Parade. This means that the cycling catchment area is more well-connected by the roads within the area. Since the cycling catchment area covers a significant part of the buffer, it shows that the existing road network is almost at optimum and  location is ideal for Singaporeans for Singaporeans to cycle to TE27 Marine Terrace with ease.\n\n\n\n\n2.7. TE28 – Siglap\n\n2.7.1. Catchment Amenities Distribution and Buffer (Walking)\n\n\n\nWalking Catchment and Buffer\n\n\nMost of the buildings within the walking catchment area of TE28 are low rise residential, suggesting that most people living in this area are of high economic status. As such, most may own private vehicles and the presence of an MRT may not be as effective to encourage people to use public transportation as their form of travel. However, it still has the potential to encourage them to switch over to public transportation occasionally and its presence can precipitate a modal shift within this population. The (high rise) residential buildings within 0-400m of the MRT may greatly serve these residents and their first mile journeys. Since the majority of the buildings in this catchment area are for residential, TE28 will greatly serve to improve first mile journeys for Singaporeans. Furthermore, Victoria School is located within 200m of the MRT, providing great convenience for these students' last mile journey as well.\nSimilarly to TE27 Marine Parade, the cycling contour intervals for TE28 Siglap are also relatively distributed. This means that the walking catchment area is more well-connected by the roads within the area. Since the walking catchment area covers a significant part of the buffer, it shows that the existing road network is almost at optimum and location is ideal for Singaporeans for Singaporeans to walk to TE28 Siglap with ease.\n\n\n2.7.2. Catchment Amenities Distribution and Buffer (Cycling)\n\n\n\nCycling Catchment and Buffer\n\n\nFor the cycling catchment area, it also mainly reaches out to more low rise residential buildings. Additionally, residential buildings in the West of this catchment area overlaps with the walking and cycling catchment area for TE27 Marine Parade. This suggests that these residents will have very convenient access to public transport, encouraging greater use of public transport. Nevertheless, the contour also reaches out to other forms of building types such as warehouses in the North of this Iso-Area. Hence, workers may benefit from this MRT as they are able to easily travel to work by cycling from the MRT since it is a manageable distance from the MRT station.  Since workers in warehouses generally earn a medium income level, having convenient access to public transport would greatly benefit them as they would not need to spend money on private transportation such as taxis. Thus, last mile journey will improve for them.\nSimilarly to TE27 Marine Parade, the cycling contour intervals for TE28 Siglap are also relatively well-distributed. This means that the walking catchment area is more well-connected by the roads within the area. Since the cycling catchment area covers a significant part of the buffer, it shows that the existing road network is almost at optimum and location is ideal for Singaporeans to cycle to TE28 Siglap with ease.\n\n\n\n2.8. TE29 – Bayshore\n\n2.8.1. Catchment Amenities Distribution and Buffer (Walking)\n\n\n\nWalking Catchment and Buffer\n\n\nAll types of residential buildings lie close on the North and West sides of TE29 Bayshore. Interestingly, an equal number of residential and low rise residential buildings fall within 0-600m of the catchment area. This suggests that the main intended beneficiaries of this station would be for the first mile journey for all socioeconomic classes residents in this catchment area. The inclusion of the higher socioeconomic class means that the wealthier residents may be encouraged to use private transport less and instead use public transport. \nGiven that this catchment area is quite small, TE29 Bayshore still has 5 MRT exits, two of which do not have any buildings or POIs near them. This may suggest that these 2 exits in the East of TE29 Bayshore MRT are redundant since any other POIs or buildings are closer to the 3 other exits that TE29 Bayshore already has. Building unnecessary exits may cause users alighting at TE29 Bayshore to get confused by which exit to come out from, causing accidental mistakes and prolonging the last mile journey. Hence, this may make the last mile journey for people alighting at TE29 Bayshore more difficult and unpleasant.\nThe buffer area for TE29 Bayshore covers a much significant area as compared to the catchment area. We can see that the East Coast Park (ECP) at the South-East of the buffer area cannot be accessed by the contour area at all, suggesting that there is a very poor road network in this region. To counter this, better road networks can be implemented, such as underpass or overhead bridge across the ECP highway in this South-East region in order to improve last mile journeys to ECP. Furthermore, this will then put the 2 exits on the East of TE29 Bayshore MRT to good use.\n\n\n2.8.2. Catchment Amenities Distribution and Buffer (Cycling)\n\n\n\nCycling Catchment and Buffer\n\n\nFor the cycling catchment area, more amenities are covered. More housing estates, as well as schools can be reached. These institutions lie within 1-1.2km of the MRT, a less than 10 minutes cycle. Hence, this convenience may encourage students to cycle to school from the MRT, providing an alternative option for their last mile journey. Now that the Iso-Area is larger, the parts of ECP that could not be reached by the walking contour, yet reachable by the walking buffer can now be accessed. This is due to connecting roads on the further East side of this catchment area. However, this suggests that people would have to walk the cycling route to get to that inaccessible area (if they do not wish to cycle), which may be quite an inconvenient walk for them as the distance is quite large for walking. Hence, people may still fall back on using private transport for this last mile journey, or they may even choose to opt for travelling with private vehicles altogether from the start of their journey.\nSimilarly to TE28 Siglap, the cycling contour intervals for TE29 Bayshore are also relatively distributed. This means that the cycling catchment area is more well-connected by the roads within the area. Since the cycling catchment area covers a significant part of the buffer, it shows that the existing road network is almost at optimum and location is ideal for Singaporeans to cycle to TE29 Bayshore with ease."

    "text": "3. Lessons Learnt\nThe catchment areas, for both walking and cycling, show us that the main beneficiaries of  the TEL Stage 4 MRT stations are the residents. This is primarily due to the large catering of land use by the Master Plan 2019 toward Residential along the East Coast of Singapore in the Marine Parade Subzone. These Residential land use will hence have the greatest direct impact by the presence of TEL. \nWith the majority of these residential buildings being low rise residential estates, the TEL Stage 4 MRT Stations may achieve its goal of encouraging more wealthy people to switch to public transportation through the promotion of higher convenience and increased accessibility to public transportation. There is now a higher hope that the majority of these residents will take up TEL Stage 4 MRT Stations for their journeys. \nTherefore, this will improve road congestion problems, making first and last mile journeys for all road users a more efficient one. Furthermore, with the TEL's aims to reduce travel time to the central area, nearby Singaporeans' needs will now be better accommodated."

Furthermore, we will explore how effective the catchment areas of the upcoming Thomson-East Coast station are based on the current road network present i encouraging Singaporeans to cycle.

For example, one combination would be cycling and taking the bus. Therefore, the proportion of Singapore who cycles and takes the MRT is far lesser than the 3.9% stated. Due to low and insignificant numbers, a more suitable analysis to evaluate its location suitability would be from the various subzones that fall within 1.6km radius instead of the number of people who is willing to cycle within the catchment area. \nThe Singapore Government only built 800 bicycle racks within the 1.5km radius of each MRT Station.

Catchment Population Distribution (Walking)\n\n\n\n\n\nBased on the Walking Catchment Population Distribution for TE22A Founders Memorial, we can see that these following subzones (Marina East and Tanjong Rhu) are captured at the 1000m mark. However, we can see that the largest proportion of catchment population falls within Tanjong Rhu. This is shown by the blue contour layers.\nWe further broke down the population distribution per contour and subzone level below to visualize these numbers more clearly. Additionally, we will be multiplying these numbers at every contour level by a ratio (as mentioned earlier) to accurately reflect how many people who are willing to walk to TE22A Founders Memorial (shown below). \nBased on the numbers generated, the following breakdown are the Singaporeans who are willing to walk to TE22A Founders Memorial based on each contour interval:\n\n0 Singaporeans within 200m contour\n0 Singaporeans within 200-400m contour\n19 Singaporeans within 400-600m contour\n115 Singaporeans within 600-800m contour\n65 Singaporeans within 800-1000m contour\n\n855 Singaporeans stay within the 1000m contour but only 199 of them are willing to walk to TE22A Founders Memorial. The percentage of catchment population who is willing to walk to MRT Station over catchment population is 23.3%. This percentage does not reflect the number of Singaporeans who is willing to take public transportation but reflects the number of Singaporeans willing to walk to MRT station.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.1.2. Catchment Population Distribution (Cycling)\n\n\n\n\n\nBased on the Cycling Catchment Population Distribution for TE22A Founders Memorial, we can see that the largest proportion of the catchment population falls within Tanjong Rhu. This is shown by the red contour layers. However, the largest subzone covered in this catchment area is Marina East. This is shown by the white contours covering almost Marina East fully. \nWe further broke down the population distribution per contour and subzone level below to visualize these numbers more clearly. Though these numbers are very large, the percentage of people who cycle is very low. As a result, these numbers do not reflect people who are willing to cycle to MRT but the distribution of catchment population within subzone areas.\nBased on the layout and numbers generated, these following subzones [Marina East (86.5%), Marina South (9.7%), Nicoll (8.1%), Marina Centre (16.5%), Marina East (MP) (2.2%) and Tanjong Rhu (20.2%)] are captured at the 1600m mark. Additionally, it is noted that:\n\nMarina South (9.7%) that is within the catchment area, covers water bodies mainly.\nDespite 8% of Nicoll falling within the catchment area, this proportion of land coverage is even smaller if we want to eliminate the proportion of Nicoll that is made up of water bodies in the catchment area.\n2.2% of Marina East (MP) falls within the cycling catchment area.\n\nAs a result, these three subzones are considered insignificant, thus we will eliminate them from the list of subzones.\nTherefore, TE22A Founders Memorial is accessible from multiple subzones by cycling:\n\nMarina East (86.5%)\nTanjong Rhu (20.2%)\nMarina Centre (16.5%)\n\n\n\n\n\n2.2. TE23 Tanjong Rhu\n\n2.2.1. Catchment Population Distribution (Walking)\n\n\n\n\n\nBased on the Walking Catchment Population Distribution for TE23 Tanjong Rhu, we can see that these following subzones (Marina East, Nicoll and Tanjong Rhu) are captured at the 1000m mark. However, we can see that the largest proportion of catchment population falls within Tanjong Rhu at the 200m mark onwards where all the residential areas lie. This is shown by the blue contour layers.\nWe further broke down the population distribution per contour and subzone level below to visualize these numbers more clearly. Additionally, we will be multiplying these numbers at every contour level by a ratio (as mentioned earlier) to accurately reflect how many people who are willing to walk to TE23 Tanjong Rhu (shown below). \nBased on the numbers generated, the following breakdown are the Singaporeans who are willing to walk to TE23 Tanjong Rhu based on each contour interval:\n\n335 Singaporeans within 200m contour\n794 Singaporeans within 200-400m contour\n613 Singaporeans within 400-600m contour\n526 Singaporeans within 600-800m contour\n313 Singaporeans within 800-1000m contour\n\n6391 Singaporeans stay within the 1000m contour but only 2581 of them are willing to walk to TE23 Tanjong Rhu. The percentage of catchment population who is willing to walk to MRT Station over catchment population is 40.4%. This percentage does not reflect the number of Singaporeans who is willing to take public transportation but reflects the number of Singaporeans willing to walk to MRT station.\n\n\n\n2.2.2. Catchment Population Distribution (Cycling)\n\n\n\n\n\nBased on the Cycling Catchment Population Distribution for TE23 Tanjong Rhu, we can see that the largest proportion of the catchment population still falls within Tanjong Rhu. This is shown by red contour layers. The largest subzone covered in this catchment area is also Tanjong Rhu. This is shown by the red contours covering Tanjong Rhu almost fully as well. \nWe further broke down the population distribution per contour and subzone level below to visualize these numbers more clearly. Though these numbers are very large, the percentage of people who cycle is very low. As a result, these numbers do not reflect people who are willing to cycle to MRT but the distribution of catchment population within subzone areas.\nBased on the layout and numbers generated, these following subzones [Alijunied (0.4%), Kampong Bugis (17.9%), Marina Centre (7.3%), Marina East (31.3%), Marina East (MP) (6.5%), Mountbatten (1.5%), Nicoll (54.5%) and Tanjong Rhu (96.4)] are captured at the 1600m mark. Additionally, it is noted that:\n\nOnly 1.5% of Mountbatten falls within the catchment area\nOnly 0.4% of Alijunied falls within the catchment area\n\nAs a result, these two subzones are considered insignificant, thus we will eliminate Mountbatten and Alijunied from the list of subzones.\nTherefore, TE22A Founders Memorial is accessible from multiple subzones by cycling:\n\nTanjong Rhu (96.4)\nNicoll (54.5%)\nMarina East (31.3%)\nKampong Bugis (17.9%)\nMarina Centre (7.3%)\nMarina East (MP) (6.5%)\n\n\n\n\n\n2.3.

Catchment Population Distribution (Walking)\n\n\n\n\n\nBased on the Walking Catchment Population Distribution for TE24 Katong Park, we can see that these following subzones (Aljunied, Marina East (MP), Mountbattenl and Tanjong Rhu) are captured at the 1000m mark. However, we can see that the largest proportion of catchment population falls within Mountbatten. This is shown by the darkest blue contour layer.\nWe further broke down the population distribution per contour and subzone level below to visualize these numbers more clearly. Additionally, we will be multiplying these numbers at every contour level by a ratio (as mentioned earlier) to accurately reflect how many people who are willing to walk to TE22A Founders Memorial (shown below). \nBased on the numbers generated, the following breakdown are the Singaporeans who are willing to walk to TE24 Katong Park based on each contour interval:\n\n396 Singaporeans within 200m contour\n979 Singaporeans within 200-400m contour\n818 Singaporeans within 400-600m contour\n691 Singaporeans within 600-800m contour\n413 Singaporeans within 800-1000m contour\n\n8302 Singaporeans stays within the 1000m contour but only 3297 of them are willing to walk to TE24 Katong Park. The percentage of catchment population who is willing to walk to MRT Station over catchment population is 39.7%. This percentage does not reflect the number of Singaporeans who is willing to take public transportation but reflects the number of Singaporeans willing to walk to MRT station.\n\n\n\n\n2.3.2. Catchment Population Distribution (Walking)\n\n\n\n\n\nBased on the Cycling Catchment Population Distribution for TE24 Katong Park, we can see that the largest proportion of the catchment population falls within Mountbatten. This is shown by the darkest red contour. The largest subzone covered in this catchment area is also Mountbatten. This is shown by the largest contour covering almost Mountbatten fully as well. \nWe further broke down the population distribution per contour and subzone level below to visualize these numbers more clearly. Though these numbers are very large, the percentage of people who cycle is very low. As a result, these numbers do not reflect people who are willing to cycle to MRT but the distribution of catchment population within subzone areas.\nBased on the layout and numbers generated, these following subzones [Alijunied (13.8%), East Coast (0.5%), Geylang East (0.1%), Katong (0.9%), Marina East (4.3%), Marina East (MP) (94.9%), Marine Parade (3.2%), Mountbatten (91.2%) and Tanjong Rhu (54.1%)] are captured at the 1600m mark. Additionally, it is noted that:\n\n4.3% of Marina East falls within the catchment area\n3.2% of Marine Parade falls within the catchment area\n0.9% of Katong falls within the catchment area\n0.5% of East Coast falls within the catchment area\n0.1% of Geylang East falls within the catchment area\n\nAs a result, these five subzones are considered insignificant, thus we will eliminate them from the list of subzones.\nTherefore, TE24 Katong Park is accessible from multiple subzones by cycling:\n\nMarina East (MP) (94.9%)\nMountbatten (91.2%) \nTanjong Rhu (54.1%)\nAlijunied (13.8%)\n\n \n\n\n\n2.4. TE25 Tanjong Katong\n\n2.4.1. Catchment Population Distribution (Walking)\n\n\n\n\n\nBased on the Walking Catchment Population Distribution for TE25 Tanjong Katong, we can see that these following subzones (East Coast, Katong, Marina East (MP), Marine Parade and Mountbatten) are captured at the 1000m mark. However, we can see that the largest proportion of catchment population falls within Marine Parade. This is shown by the darkest blue contour layers.\nWe further broke down the population distribution per contour and subzone level below to visualize these numbers more clearly. Additionally, we will be multiplying these numbers at every contour level by a ratio (as mentioned earlier) to accurately reflect how many people who are willing to walk to TE25 Tanjong Katong (shown below). \nBased on the numbers generated, the following breakdown are the Singaporeans who are willing to walk to TE25 Tanjong Katong based on each contour interval:\n\n617 Singaporeans within 200m contour\n2444 Singaporeans within 200-400m contour\n1680 Singaporeans within 400-600m contour\n1111 Singaporeans within 600-800m contour\n768 Singaporeans within 800-1000m\n\n15857 Singaporeans stay within the 1000m contour but only 6620 of them are willing to walk to TE25 Tanjong Katong.

    "text": "3. Lessons Learnt\n\n3.1 Conclusion of Walking Population Analysis\nThe percentage of the catchment population who is willing to walk from maximum Iso Area Distance of 1000m from all TEL Stage 4 MRT Stations mainly falls within 33.0% to 46.1% with an outlier of 23.3% for TE22A Founders Memorial. The ranking of effectiveness of MRT Station in capturing Singaporeans to walk to MRT Stations goes as follows:\n\nTE27 Marine Terrace 46.1%\nTE26 Marine Parade 45.9%\nTE25 Tanjong Katong 41.7%\nTE23 Tanjong Rhu 40.4%\nTE24 Katong Park 39.7%\nTE28 Siglap 36.8%\nTE29 Bayshore 33.0%\nTE22A Founders Memorial 23.3%\n\n \nPercentage for Founders Memorial is low due to the MRT being built nearer towards recreational land uses such as East Coast Park Zone A and Marina Bay Golf Course. Therefore, it mainly provides leisure Singaporeans and tourists greater access to nature reserves and recreational venues. As a result, it explains its low percentage. This does not mean that the location of this MRT Station is not ideal but it is effective in aiding Singaporeans in their last mile journeys by increasing accessibility to remote areas of Singapore.\nPercentages for Marine Terrace and Marine Parade are extremely high as compared to the rest due to the MRT Stations being built at locations with high proportions of residential areas, which explains the high subzone populations as well. Therefore, locations of these two MRT Stations are extremely ideal as they are effective in aiding Singaporeans in their first mile journeys by increasing accessibility to them.\n\n\n3.2 Conclusion of Cycling Population Analysis\nThe number of subzones captured from maximum Iso Area Distance of 1600m falls within 3 to 7 with TE22A Founders Memorial being the least accessible. The ranking of effectiveness of MRT Station in capturing Singaporeans to cycle to MRT Stations goes as follows:\n\nTE26 Marine Parade 7\nTE25 Tanjong Katong 6\nTE23 Tanjong Rhu 6\nTE27 Marine Terrace 5\nTE28 Siglap 5\nTE24 Katong Park 4\nTE29 Bayshore 4\nTE22A Founders Memorial 3\n\nTE22A Founders Memorial managed to capture the least subzones due to its low accessibility as a result of it being surrounded by water bodies. Though it initially captured 6 different subzones, 3 of them are not accessible if the maximum distance travelled based on the existing road network is 1600m. Therefore, TE22A Founders Memorial is the least accessible if Singaporeans want to cycle to it as well.\nTE26 Marine Parade managed to capture the most subzone due to its size of MRT Station. Being the largest MRT Station with its exits being most distributed across the MRT Station, its accessibility is maximised as it was able to branch out extensively to more subzones. Therefore, TE26 Marine Parade is the most accessible if Singaporeans want to cycle to it.\nTE25 Tanjong Katong is ranked higher than TE23 Tanjong Rhu as total catchment area for TE25 Tanjong Katong (3868708.0m2) is higher than that of TE23 Tanjong Rhu (3562429.2m2). Therefore, TE25 Tanjong Katong is more accessible than TE23 Tanjong Rhu based on existing road networks for both MRT Stations. \nSimilarly for TE24 Katong Park and TE29 Bayshore, total catchment area for TE24 Katong Park (4797523.0m2) is higher than that of TE29 Bayshore (3689993.5m2). Therefore, TE24 Katong Park is more accessible than TE29 Bayshore based on existing road networks for both MRT Stations, TE24 Katong Park will rank higher than TE29 Bayshore."
