It hopes to better serve communities living in the North-South corridor and the East by cutting down travel times to the Central area from 55min to 35min.\nThis is in conjunction with Singapore’s Green Plan which, among others, aims to significantly reduce our carbon emissions and ensure that Singapore is more sustainable. One way would be to reduce demand for private transportation.\nOur focus is on the Stage 4 stations (Founders Memorial to Bayshore) , which are currently in the works and will be opened by 2025."

    "text": "Motivations\nThe Ministry of Transport aims to have 8 in 10 households in Singapore be within a 10 minute walk of an MRT. This was driven by the need to ensure that transit within Singapore continues to be sustainable and to reduce carbon emissions to combat climate change, which is one of the main goals highlighted in the Singapore Green Plan.\nAt present, most Singapore residents do not own a car. Instead, they use public transport such as buses and trains. This is due to the costliness in purchasing and maintaining a car. However, many people still find public transportation to be insufficient, with many wealthier people and families opting for car ownership instead. This is partially driven by the comfort and ease that driving provides to its riders.\nHowever, this contributes to our carbon emissions and makes meeting the goals set by the Green Plan difficult to achieve. This is compounded by the fact that car ownership is a negative externality. Despite the convenience it affords to its owners, it aggravates traffic and is a source of various types of pollution apart from air pollution, such as noise.\nThis points to a need to strengthen our public transportation system and to accommodate the diverse needs of Singapore residents."

As a result, we are not able to download but can only extract out the exits with reference to the MRT layout pictures on LTA website.\n\n3.3.1 Importing OSM and Opening LTA MRT Website\nWe will be guiding you through the extraction of TE22A Founders Memorial Exits as an example. Each MRT should have one layer with all its respective exits. Therefore, we need to create 7 more vector point layers on top of TE22A Founders Memorial Exits layer\n\nImport OSM layer from Browser. You will need to refer to the LTA Website as you pick the exit points out. Your screen should look similar to the screenshot as shown below.\n\nClick the LTA Website Link as given above and scroll down till you find TE22A Founders Memorial under Location of Stations. Your screen should look similar to the screenshot as shown below:\n\n\n\n\n3.3.2 Creating a New Layer for TE22A Founder’s Memorial Exits\n\nUnder Layers at the top menu bar, hover your cursor over Create Layers and click on New Shapefile Layer.\n\n\nYour screen should similar to the screenshot below:\n\n\n\n\n\nFill n the specific information as shown in the screenshot below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnder the Fields List, click on id and delete it by clicking \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, we will start naming our attributes. Once every attribute is filled up, we can click on  to create the field. We need the following attributes:\n\nFid (Type: Integer, Length: 10)\n\nMRT line (Type: String, Length: 30)\n\nExit (Type: String, Length: 30)\n\n\n\nAfter creating all 3 variables, your screen should look similar to the screenshot below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce you click on OK, you can see that TE22A Founder Memorial Exits is added to your layer Menu as a Layer as shown below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you open your attribute table for TE22A Founders Memorial Exits, you will realize that the Attribute Table is empty. Your screen should look like the screenshot as shown below. We will be adding the exit points manually in the next section.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.3.3 Adding Exit Points into Founders Memorial Exit Layer\n\nOpen the Attribute Table of TE22A Founders Memorial Exits by right-clicking it in the layer menu\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick on  so that editing mode can be turned on so that we can start adding the exit points in.\nOnce you exit the Attribute Table, click on in the top menu and start marking the exit points out with reference to the TE22A Founders Memorial Layout from the LTA Website.\n\nTry to refer to the geographical features (eg. Roads and streets) from both the OSM layer that we previously imported, and image from the LTA website to get as accurate of an exit point as possible. For each exit points selected, fid will be in numerical order and Exits will be in alphabetical order\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce both exits of TE22A Founders Memorial MRT Station has been marked out, click on Toggle Editing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSave the changes made by clicking Save\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYour screen should similar to the screenshot shown below\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet’s compare this to the TE22A Founders Memorial Exits from the LTA website:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet’s compare this to the TE22A Founders Memorial Exits from the LTA website\n\n\n\n\nOur GIS\nLTA Website\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can see that the points are quite similar in both images but just bear in mind that these points that you have plotted will not be accurate to that of LTA website and my screenshots due to human error. However, you do not have to worry because the results will just vary slightly.\nNow when you open your Attribute Table for TE22A Founders Memorial Exits, you can see that there will be 2 rows of data, reflecting the two exits for the MRT Station. Your screen should look similar to the screenshot as shown below\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDIY\n\n\n\nUsing the steps you had learned in previous hands-on exercise, save this layer into your GeoPackage as TE22A Founders Memorial MRT Exits\n\n\n\n\n3.3.4. Explain Outliers for TE26 Marine Parade\n\nThere will be some MRT Outline Layer from Data.gov which might not tally to the MRT Outline from LTA. Let’s take TE26 Marine Parade as an example\n\n\n\n\nOur QGIS (from data.gov)\nLTA Website\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can see that TE26 Marine Parade Outline from Data.gov is significantly shorter than that of LTA Website. However, exit points will be flushed more together than that of LTA website and the roads near the exit points will vary significantly if we want to take TE26 Marine Parade Outline from Data.gov as reference. This will significantly affect our analysis (shortest distance taken) later.\nTherefore, it would be better to take TE26 Marine Parade Outline from LTA Website as reference since it would be more accurate geographically and plot exit points out of TE26 Marine Parade MRT Outline from Data.gov. Your screen should look similar to the screenshot as shown below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.3.5. Extracting Exit Points as Individual Layers for the rest of TE24 MRT Stations\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nUsing the steps you had learned earlier, create 7 MRT Exits layers for the rest of the MRT Stations and save them into your GeoPackage as\n\nTE23 Tanjong Rhu MRT Exits – 2 Exits\nTE24 Katong Park MRT Exits – 2 Exits\nTE25 Tanjong Katong MRT Exits – 3 Exits\nTE26 Marine Parade MRT Exits – 6 Exits\nTE27 Marine Terrace MRT Exits – 6 Exits\nTE28 Siglap MRT Exits – 4 Exits\nTE29 Bayshore MRT Exits – 5 Exits\n\nYour screen should look like the screenshot as shown below\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.4 Extracting and Preparing road network layer\nI can’t emphasize enough the importance of a quality data preparation in GIS analysis. In this sub-section, you will use basic QGIS functions to perform the following data preparation tasks:\n\nselecting all roads features with the study area\nextracting appropriate road classes for the analysis\n\n\n3.4.1.

It will take awhile for QGIS to run due to large data to process but once the process is completed, a new temporary layer Clipped should appear in your Layers Menu.\nYour screen should look like the screenshot as shown below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBe Warned\n\n\n\nThe original data is in wgs84. For the purpose of network analysis, the road data must be in projected coordinates system (i.e. svy21 in Singapore).\n\n\n\n\n3.4.2. Extracting suitable road network\nSince we want to study the catchment area for walking and cycling, we do not need these following road feature classes:\n\nTrunk\nTrunk_link\nMotorway\nMotorway_link\n\nTherefore, we need to remove them before saving the rest of the road feature classes into our GeoPackage.\n\nOpen the Attribute Table of Clipped\n\nYour screen should look similar to the screenshot as shown below:\n\nClick on  in the menu. Your screen should look like the screenshot as shown below:\n\nTo extract out the following Roads by name,\n1) Motorway\n2) Motorway Link\n3) Trunk\n4) Trunk Link\nType in the following expression as shown in the screenshot below and click on \n\n\n\n\nYou can see from that 6830 rows are selected.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDIY\n\n\n\nClick on  to push these 8 rows to the top. Your screen should look similar to the screenshot below\n\n\n\n\nHowever, since you only want the road feature fclasses that are not these selected features, click on  to invert the selection\nYou can see from that 219057 rows are selected.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDIY\n\n\n\nUsing the steps you had learned earlier, save these selected features as a new layer as OSM_Roads into your GeoPackage\n\n\n\n\n\n3.5. – Extracting and Preparing Building, Points of Interest and Transport Layers\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDIY\n\n\n\nUsing the steps you had learned earlier, conduct data preparation and save gis_osm_buildings_a_free_1 as OSM_Buildings, gis_osm_pois_free_1, OSM_POIs and gis_osm_transport_a_free_1 as OSM_Transport into your GeoPackage Your screen should look like the screenshot as shown below\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRemember\n\n\n\nRemove all the source data from QGIS project before continue to the next section\n\n\n\n\n3.6 Downloading Singapore Residents by Planning Area / Subzone, Single Year of Age and Sex, June 2011-2020\n\n3.6.1. Importing Singapore Residents by Planning Area / Subzone, Single Year of Age and Sex, June 2011-2020 Data into QGIS\n\nDownload Singapore Residents by Planning Area / Subzone, Single Year of Age and Sex, June 2011-2020 Data from singstats.gov.sg and import it into QGIS.\n\n\n\nFrom the Layer Panel, navigate to the path of Add Delimited Text Layer as shown in the screenshot below.\n\n\n\n\nDouble-click on Add Delimited Text Layer and browse for respopagesex2011to2020 by clicking    which is at the right of File name.

By and large, there are two approaches, namely shortest network distance and fastest network distance. In this sub-section, shortest network distance approach will be used. You will learn how to delineate service area using fastest distance approach in the next sub-section.\nTo delineate service area using shortest distance approach, Iso-Area as Polygons (from Layer) function of QNEAT3 will be used.\n\nFrom QGIS’s menu bar, select Processing -> Toolbox.\n\nThe Processing Toolbox panel appears.\n\nSelect QNEATS3 -> Iso-Areas -> Iso-Area as Polygons (from Layer).\n\n\nThe Iso-Area as Polygons (From Layer) dialog window appears.\n\nFor Vector layer representing network, select Roads from the drop-down list.\nFor Start Points, select TE22A Founders Memorial from the drop-down list.\n\nNotice that both GIS layers are in projected coordinates system (i.e. EPSG:3414 which is svy21).\n\nFor Unique Point ID field, select fid from the drop-down list.\nFor Size of Iso-Area (distance or time value), type 1000.\nFor Contour Interval, type 200.\nFor Path type to calculate, select Shortest Path (distance optimization) from the drop-down list.\nFor Value for Default Speed (km/h), type in 4.44 \n\nKeep the rest of the entries as default.\nYour screen should look similar to the screenshot below.\n \nWhen you are ready to run the function,\n\nclick on the Run button.\n\nThe process involves massive computation and will take a while to complete (usually less than 5 mins in a standard 64bit machine).\nWhen the process completed, two temporary layers namely: Output Polygon and Output Interpolation will be added onto Layers panel and display on QGIS View window.\n\nThe Output Interpolation layer is a raster layer created using triangular irregular network (TIN).

Extracting Buildings within Catchment Areas for Amenities Analysis for TE29 Bayshore\nTo identify the buildings that we want, we must first open the Iso-Area layer. This way, we can see what are the buildings that fall within the catchment area that requires us to recategorize. We will be guiding you through the extraction of amenities that fall within TE29 Bayshore Contours (Walking) as an example.\n\n5.1.1. Classifying Buildings\nIn the Layers panel, ensure that TE29 Bayshore Contours (Walking) layer is on\n\nOpen the Layer Properties ofOSM_Building.\nClick on Symbology tab\nAt the top of the Symbology dialog, change Type to Categorized.\n\nFor Value, select Type\n\nClick Classify. Your screen should look similar to the screenshot as shown below.\n\n\nClick OK and your screen should look similar to the screenshot as shown below\n\n\n\n5.1.2. Identifying Buildings that are NULL within the Catchment Area\nUpon closer inspection on Attribute Table for the OSM_Buildings layer, we find that many have null Type values. Since the Type is the property that will be able to differentiate the nature of the buildings, we will need to fix this. Therefore, we need to perform recategorizing of the building types.\n\nIn the Layers panel, right click on OSM_Buildings and open its Attributes Table. \nUse Select Features by Area or Select Feature(s)  and click on one of the buildings in red in the screenshot as shown below. (Your buildings may have a different color combination)\n\n\n\n\nWe see that the Type is null for these buildings.\n\n\nNow, we will need to use external software, Google Maps or Maps, to identify our building type with existing visual data and change it in our Attributes Table accordingly.\n\nClick on the Toggle Editing Mode icon  in the Attributes Table to allow for editing function. \n\n\n\n5.1.3 Data Cleaning for NULL Buildings within the Catchment Area\nBelow shows a table of how and why we recategorize NULL buildings into the correct building types that we use in our analysis.\n\n\n\nBuildings\nType\nExamples\nJustification\n\n\n\n\nNursing care homes\n“residential”\nEcon Nursing Home Services (1987) Ptd Ltd\nRefer to Appendix A Figure 1.\nAccording to the Urban Redevelopment Authority (2019), nursing care homes are either zoned as “Civic and Community Institution’’ or”Residential/Institution” in the Master Plan. However, since elderly live in these homes, we decided to classify them as “residential”.\n\n\n“apartments” /  “condominium” / “hall”\n“residential”\nRefer to Appendix A Figure 2.\nOur term “residential” would refer to residential buildings that are not low rise (which are only 4 or less storeys high). These buildings will then be classified as buildings that have a large population density, and they approximately hold the same number of residents as Housing & Development Board (HDB) buildings. HDB buildings will be classified as “residential” as well.\n\n\nLanded houses / terrace houses\n“Low rise residential”\nRefer to Appendix A Figure 3.\nThese building types are low rise, and they only serve as residential blocks for a small number of people. This will allow us to estimate the amount of people that are affected in this building type during our analysis.\n\n\n“semidetached_house” / “detached” / “bungalow” / “house”\n“Low rise residential”\nRefer to Appendix A Figure 4.\nThis is for standardisation and data cleaning as they all serve to hold a small number of people.\n\n\nRepair shops / Servicing shops / Stand-alone Small Businesses /\n“business”\nRefer to Appendix A Figure 5.\nThese are small businesses that operate for profit making. We follow the business types according to the URA (2022) classification guideline.\n\n\n“office” / “shop”\n“business”\nRefer to Appendix A Figure 6.\n“office” buildings would be considered large corporate businesses. We classify them together with other small businesses because we want to generalise how business workers will be affected by the MRT stations when travelling to or from work.\n“shop” are recategorized to “business” because they are a subset of a business. “shop” have the same nature as stand-alone small businesses and offices since they are buildings for people to work in.\n\n\nReligious buildings /\n“chapel” / “church” / “mosque” / “religion” / “religious” / “shrine” / “temple”\n“Place of worship”\nRefer to Appendix A Figure 7.\nWe recategorize to make the classification cleaner and neater by having all religious forms of activity classified under 1 label. We use this term according to URA’s as they term it “place of worship” as well.\n\n\nCommunity Centres / Police Station / Town Hall\n“C&CI”\nRefer to Appendix A Figure 8.\nAccording to the URA, these building types are commonly termed “Civic and Community Institution”, “C&CI” in short. Therefore, we follow these guidelines when classifying and giving these buildings a term.\n\n\n“civic” / “clubhouse” / “club house” / “fire_station” / “government” / “public” / “sports_centre” / “sports_hall” / “stadium”\n“C&CI”\nRefer to Appendix A Figure 9.\n\n\n\n“garage” / “garages”\n“C&CI”\n-\nThis is for standardization and data cleaning.\n\n\nStand-alone Restaurants / Cafe\n“food”\nRefer to Appendix A Figure 10.\nSince these buildings are stand-alone, they only serve one purpose which is providing food service. We can distinguish these food shops from “business” to show how food places, food choices, and food availability may be affected by residents in catchment areas due to the MRT.\n\n\nShophouses\n“commercial”\nRefer to Appendix A Figure 11.\nThese shophouses often encompass many different types of uses such as eateries, convenience stores, salons, houses, small company enterprises, and many more. Hence, it is unfeasible and will be inaccurate to distinctively mark out every unit into a certain building type. Furthermore, this will complicate the classification process and create too many classes that will be too specific. Hence, we classify them as “commercial” to show that these buildings have many different uses.\n\n\n“toilets”\n“toilet”\n-\nThis is for standardization and data cleaning.\n\n\nBuilding structures that do not appear on Google Maps / Building structures that cannot be classified by eye\n“unclassified”\nRefer to Appendix A Figure 12.\nThese do not have a label on Google. Hence, we are not able to identify its specific use and it is better not to assume of the building use. Furthermore, their use may differ at different times of the year. Therefore, we do not know the true purpose of these building types.\n\n\nPrimary schools / Secondary schools / Preschools / School organizations\n“school”\nRefer to Appendix A Figure 13.\nThese building types are distinctively classified as “school”.\n\n\n“kindergarten”\n“school”\n-\nThis is for standardization and data cleaning.\n\n\nPetrol stations\n“transport facilities”\nRefer to Appendix A Figure 14.\nAccording to the URA (2019), these buildings are deemed as “transport facilities”.\n\n\n\n\nAfter editing, click on Toggle Editing Mode icon. A pop-up window will appear as shown below\n\n\n\n\nClick on Save when the prompt appears.\n\n\n\n5.1.4 Extracting all Buildings in Catchment Area\nSince we want to analyze the types of buildings that fall under TE29 Bayshore Contours (Walking), we need to extract them out. \n\nIn the Attributes Toolbar, click on Select by Location \n\nThe Select by Location dialog windows appear.\n\nFrom Select features from, select OSM_Buildings \nTick the checkbox in front of Intersect under the Where he Features \nFrom By Comparing to the Features from, select TE29 Bayshore Contours (Walking). Your screen should look similar to the screenshot below.\n\n\n\n\nClick Run. Your screen should look similar to the screenshot as shown below.\n\n\n\nHowever, we see that some buildings within the catchment area are not selected because the contour does not cover those parts. However, all buildings directly beside would be reachable within the Iso-Area of 1 km for walking and 1.5 km for cycling. Hence, we need to make sure that these buildings are also selected.\n\nIn the Attributes Toolbar, click on Select Feature(s)\n\nIn your keyboard, press on the Shift key as you click on the additional buildings that are directly beside the Catchment Areas on your QGIS.\n\nNow, we need to save this to our GeoPackage.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDIY\n\n\n\nUsing the steps you had learned earlier, save these selected features as a new layer as TE29_ buildings_walking into your GeoPackage. Your screen should look similar to the screenshot as show below before clicking OK\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom your Layers Menu, you can see a new layer TE29_ buildings_walking is created\n\nHowever, since the buildings are now uncategorized, you must categorize them again. Since the null building types are updated in TE29_ buildings_walking, no further data cleaning is required, and categorizing is enough.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDIY\n\n\n\nUsing the steps you had learned earlier, categorize TE29_ buildings_walking based on their fclass under Symbology in Layer Properties\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDIY\n\n\n\nUsing the steps you had learned earlier, repeat all the steps in section 1.6 for all walking and building contours for all TEL 4 Stage 4 MRT Stations into your GeoPackage\n\n\n\n\n\n5.2 Extracting Points of Interests within Catchment Areas for Amenities Analysis for TE29 Bayshore\nWe also want to analyze the types of POIs that will be affected by the TEL Stage 4 MRT stations. Hence, we also need to get the POIs that fall within the catchment area for both walking and cycling. The steps to do so are also the same as for Buildings.\n\n5.2.1. Extracting all Points of Interest in Catchment Area\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDIY\n\n\n\nUsing the steps you had learned earlier, extract all Points of Interests that falls under TE29 Bayshore Contours (Walking) and save these selected features as a new layer as TE29_pois_walking into your GeoPackage.

    "text": "7. Creating Layouts for Amenities Analysis\nTo analyze what are the buildings and POIs within the catchment area that are affected by the MRT stations, other than categorizing them into their building types and POI class, we want to get the count of these categories. This way, we can get deeper insights as to who exactly are those that are affected by the MRT, and how many of these people are affected. We will do so by making use of the bar graph plot functionality in QGIS to plot the count of these amenities. We will be guiding you through the creation of TE29 Bayshore Contours (Walking) amenities layout as an example.\n\n7.1. Getting Counts for Both Buildings and POIs\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDIY\n\n\n\nUsing the steps that you learnt earlier, open DB Manager and select either TE29_buildings_walking or TE29_pois_walking under Project Layers.\n\n\n\nClick on the SQL Window icon .\nIn the query, write these SQL codes depending on which layer you start first:\n\nTE29_buildings_walking\n\nTE29_pois_walking\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Execute\n\nAfter inspecting the query loaded and making sure that it is correct, whereby there is a type and count column, you can proceed to save this query you created.

A pop-up window will appear as shown below\n\nAs we aim to capitalize the string data in ‘SZ’ column, fill in the Output Field Name and the Output Field Type as shown below.\n\nType the following code as shown below\n\n\nThe preview will show you what the new string will be in the new column ‘SUBZONE’\n\nClick OK and you will see that a new column ‘SUBZONE’ is added to your 2020POP’s Attribute Table\n\n\nHowever, the table will be in edit format, so you need to save the changes that you had made.\n\nClick on  (top left of your screen). A pop-up will appear as shown below and click Save\n\n\n\n\n8.2. Performing Relational Join Between MP19_Subzone and 2020POP layers\nNow you are ready to perform relational join between the MP19_Subzone layer and the 2020POP layer. To join the Attribute Table of a geospatial data and an aspatial Attribute Table, we need to identify the common key or popularly known as Unique Identifier between these two data sets with we had prepared earlier. In this case, it is the Subzone Names (‘SUBZONE’ and ‘SUBZONE_N’)\n\nYou are ready to join both tables now.\n\nFrom the Layers panel, double-click on MP19_Subzone layer.\n\nThe Layer Properties dialog window appears.\n\nFrom the Tab menu, click on the Joins tab.\n\nYour screen should look similar to the screenshot below.\n\n\nClick on Add New Join icon \n\nThe Add Vector Join dialog window appears.\n\nFor Join Layer, select 2020POP from the drop-down list.\nFor Join field, select SUBZONE from the drop-down list.\nFor Target field, select SUBZONE_N from the drop-down list.\n\nClick on OK button to perform the relational join.\n\nYou will return to the Layer Properties dialog window.\nNotice that a relational joined between 2020POP Attribute Table and the Attribute Table of MP19_Subzone has been created.\n\nAt the Layer Properties dialog window, click on the OK button.\n\nStrange, it seems that nothing had happened!\n\nAt the Layers panel, right click on MP19_Subzone layer and select open Attribute Table from the context menu.\n\nYou will notice that the table now contains additional fields from 2020POP attribute layer.\n\nRemember that this joint is temporary. It is not part of the Attribute Table of MP19_Subzone layer but is just linked dynamically to the 2020POP layer. If you want to permanently join the attributes, you must save it as a new layer.\n\nTo double check if both attribute tables are joined properly, click on \n\nIf the rows are not joined properly, values belonging to 2020POP in Attribute Table of MP19_Subzone will reflect as NULL. Therefore, we will have to find NULL values by using the following expression as shown below\n\nType the following code as shown in the screenshot below\n\nClick on Select Features \n\nYou can tell that from  that 0 row is selected which means that both attributes’ tables are joined properly\n\n\n8.3. Creating Choropleth Map for Subzone Population\nIn this section, you will learn how to create a choropleth map showing the distribution of 2020 population in 2020POP by MP19_Subzone.\nYou are ready to prepare the choropleth now.\n\nFrom the Layers panel, double-click on MP19_Subzone layer.\n\nThe Layer Properties dialog window appears.\n\nClick on Symbology tab.\nAt Symbol selection drop-down list, select Graduated from the drop-down list.\nFor Value, select 2020POP_total_pop from the drop-down list.\nFor Classes, keep it as 5.\nFor Color Ramp, choose Blues or any colour of your choice from the drop-down list.\nFor Mode, choose Natural Breaks (Jenks) from the drop-down list. \nClick on Classify button.\n\nYour screen should look similar to the figure below.\n\nYou can review the statistical distribution of the classification in histogram.\n\nClick on the Histogram tab.\nClick on Load values button.\n\nYour screen should look similar to the figure below.\n\nThis feature is very useful for casual data analysts because the histogram helps us to understand the differences of each classification method.\n\nClick on Classes tab.\nClick on Apply button.\nClick on the OK button.\n\nYour screen should look similar to the figure below.\n\n\n\n8.4. Calculating Catchment Population\nWe will be guiding you through the calculation of Catchment Population for TE27 Marine Terrace Contours (Walking) as an example.\n\n8.4.1. Creating a ‘Subzone_Area’ column for MP19_Subzone\nTo calculate the Catchment Population, we need to find out the ratio of Subzone Catchment Area to its Subzone Area for all subzones that falls within each contour line first. \nDIY: Using the steps that you learned earlier, open Attribute Table of MP19_Subzone and click on Open Field Calculator. Your screen should look similar to the screenshot as shown below\n\nWe want to create a new column ‘Subzone_Area’ for each subzone area.\n\nType the following code as shown in the screenshot below before clicking OK\n\n\nYou will see that a new column ‘Subzone_Area’ is now created in the Attribute Table of MP19_Subzone\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDIY\n\n\n\nUsing the steps that you learnt earlier, save the changes made and filter out unnecessary columns in the Attribute Table of MP19_Subzone. Your screen should look similar to the screenshot as shown below.\n\n\n\n\n\n8.4.2. Extracting Polygons\n\nFrom Vector on the Menu, hover your cursor over Geoprocessing Tools and click on Union\n\nYour screen should look similar to the screenshot as shown below\n\nSelect the correct layers for your Input and Overlay layers as shown in the screenshot below\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDIY\n\n\n\nWith the steps that you learnt earlier, for better performance, select Do Not Filter (Better Performance) from under Invalid feature filtering for both input and overlap layers before clicking Run. Your screen should look like the screenshot as shown below. \n\n\nYou can see that a temporary layer Union is created in your layer menu.\n\nLet’s analyze the Attribute Table of this Temporary layer Union. \nDIY: With the steps that you learnt earlier, open the Attribute Table of Union. Your screen should look similar to the screenshot as shown below\n\nYou can see that it is very messy, thus filtering of column is required.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDIY\n\n\n\nWith the steps that you learnt earlier, filter out unnecessary columns and leave those columns checked as shown in the screenshot below. Your screen should look similar to the screenshot as shown below.\n\n\n\nSince you only need the rows for those in the catchment polygon layers, you need to do further data filtering.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDIY\n\n\n\nUsing the steps that you learnt earlier, click on Select by Expression and type in the following code as shown below before clicking Select Features\n\n\n\nYou can see from  that 25 rows are selected based on the condition that we had set. Now you want to save these 25 rows as TE27 Population (Walking) into your GeoPackage. However, you need to ensure that these 25 rows have a unique fid first.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDIY\n\n\n\nUsing the steps that you learnt earlier, manually change all the fid of the selected rows starting from 1 to 25 and save it. Your screen should look similar to the screenshot as shown below.\n\n\n\nOnce that is done, you can now save the selected feature into your GeoPackage now\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDIY\n\n\n\nUsing the steps that you learnt earlier, save the selected features as a layer as TE27 Population (Walking) into your GeoPackage\n\n\n\nYou can see that a permanent layer called TE27 Population (Walking) is now created in your Layer menu as shown below.\n\n\n\n8.4.3. Creating a ‘Catchment_ Subzone_Area’ Column\nTo calculate the Catchment Subzone Area, we need to open the Attribute Table for TE27 Population (Walking). \n\n\n\n\n\n\nDIY\n\n\n\nUsing the steps that you learnt earlier, open the Attribute Table for TE27 Population (Walking). Your screen should look similar to the screenshot as shown below.\n\n\n\nYou can still see that the Attribute Table contains a lot of unnecessary columns, thus we need to conduct filtering \n\n\n\n\n\n\nDIY\n\n\n\nUsing the steps that you learnt earlier, filter out unnecessary columns and leave those columns as shown below. Your screen should look similar to the screenshot as shown below\n\n\n\nNow we need to find out the area of the Catchment Subzone Area using Open Field Calculator\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDIY\n\n\n\nUsing the steps that you learnt earlier, create a new column for Catchment_Area using the following code as shown in the screenshot below before clicking OK\n\n\n\nYour Attribute Table should reflect the additional ‘Catchment_Area’ created as shown in the screenshot below. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDIY\n\n\n\nUsing the steps that you learnt earlier, save the changes made to the Attribute Table of TE27 Population (Walking)\n\n\n\n\n8.4.4. Creating a ‘Ratio’ Column for TE27 Population (Walking)\nAssuming that Population is equally distributed across the subzone area, you need to calculate the percentage of Catchment Area to respective Subzone Area. Since now you have both Catchment Subzone Area and Subzone Area, this is now possible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDIY\n\n\n\nUsing the steps that you learnt earlier, create a new column ‘Ratio’ using the Open Field Calculator in the Attribute Table and type in the following code as shown below before clicking OK\n\n\n\nYour Attribute Table should reflect the additional ‘Ratio’ created as shown in the screenshot below. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDIY\n\n\n\nUsing the steps that you learnt earlier, save the changes made to the Attribute Table of TE27 Population (Walking)\n\n\n\n\n8.4.5. Creating a ‘Catchment_Population’ Column\nSince now we have the ratio, we will calculate Catchment Population by multiplying the Subzone Population and respective ratio per subzone and contour. The assumption made above still holds.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDIY\n\n\n\nUsing the steps that you learnt earlier, create a new column ‘Catchment_Population’ using the Open Field Calculator in the Attribute Table and type in the following code as shown below before clicking OK\n\n\n\nYour Attribute Table should reflect the additional ‘Catchment_Population’ created as shown in the screenshot below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDIY\n\n\n\nUsing the steps that you learnt earlier, save the changes made to the Attribute Table of TE27 Population (Walking)\n\n\n\n\n\n8.5. Creating a Choropleth Map for Catchment Population\nTo better present the data, it would be better to represent the Catchment Population in the form of a Choropleth Map with OSM and MP19_Subzone Layers\n\n8.5.1. Creating a Choropleth Map for Catchment Population\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDIY\n\n\n\nUsing the steps that you learnt earlier, open the Layer Properties for TE27 Population (Walking) and click on the Symbology tab.\n\n\nOur value for Catchment Population Choropleth Map would be ‘Catchment_Population’. But wait! You can see from the screenshot below that this column is not present anywhere in the list of values as shown in the screenshot below.\n\nIs there any way to overcome this? Of course!\n\nClick on the  on the right side of Symbol. A pop-up should appear as shown in the screenshot below.\n\n\n\n\nType in the following code as shown below before clicking OK\n\n\nNow you can see that ‘Catchment_Population’ is reflected as the value as shown in the screenshot below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDIY\n\n\n\nUsing the steps that you learnt earlier, generate a Choropleth Map for Catchment Population. Your Symbology screen should look similar to the screenshot as shown below before clicking OK\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, you can see that a Choropleth Map is generated based on TE27 Contours (Walking)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8.5.1. Making a Transparent Fill for MP19_Subzone Layer\nHowever, this isn’t visibly pleasing. If we can show the division of MP19_Subzone and the OSM layer, it can provide us with more information for better analysis. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nDIY\n\n\n\nUsing the steps that you learnt earlier, open the Symbology tab for MP19_Subzone layer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick on Simple Fill under Fill. Your screen should look similar to the screenshot as shown below.\n\nSelect Transparent Fill under Fill color\n\nIncrease Stroke Width to 1 before clicking OK\n\n\nNow you can see from your main screen, \n\nEach Subzone is divided distinctly \nEach part of the Contour that falls in their respective Subzone\nNearby amenities (Transport, POIs and Buildings) within the Contours\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDIY\n\n\n\nUsing the steps that you learnt earlier, generate Choropleth Maps for both Walking and Cycling Contours for the rest of the TEL Stage 4 MRT Stations."

    "text": "Catchment and Buffer Area Analysis\n\nTE22A – Founders Memorial\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWalking Catchment and Buffer\n\n\n\n\n\nNotably, there are few residential areas within the walking catchment area. The residential areas are also within the 800-1000m contour, where only a small number of people would be willing to walk. However, this MRT station is near several tourist attractions such as Founder’s Memorial and Garden by the Bay East. In doing so, people who wish to visit these areas will have their needs better accommodated to and businesses that cater to them may see increased foot traffic. Hence, tourists and tourist-facing businesses are the main beneficiaries of this station. \nThe buffer area covers the area across the bridge while the catchment area that is based on the road network cuts off before the bridge. This suggests that there is the potential for encouraging walks across the bridge that has not yet been fully tapped into yet. To do so, more direct networks could be built such that travellers would be able to cross the bridge without having to use other forms of transport such as buses or taxis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCycling Catchment and Buffer\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the cycling catchment area, more residential areas are covered within it. This could encourage residents to cycle to the MRT instead of driving to their destination. Hence, this could reduce demand for private forms of transportation and encourage them to cycle to the nearby MRT stations.\nFurthermore, Promenade MRT (CC4/DT14) lies within the cycling catchment area. This means that line transfers for cyclists who need to travel to a station in the Thomson-East Coast line can do so easily without having to take the bus or private transport.\nThis will significantly improve first and last mile journeys using public transport for those who are willing to cycle since the reach of TE22A has expanded to those that start or end their journey anywhere along the Thomson-East Coast line or the Circle line.\n\n\nTE23 – Tanjong Rhu\n\n\n\n\nWalking Catchment and Buffer\n\n\n\nCompared to Founder’s Memorial, the buffer area and the catchment areas are very similar to each other. This means that this area is very well-connected by the roads and walk/cycleways within the area and no new pathways need to be built to accommodate easier transit\nThere are more buildings covered by Tanjong Rhu catchment area as compared to Founder’s Memorial catchment area. However, some of which lie in both catchment areas. These buildings in the overlapping catchment areas include residential and commercial buildings. Therefore, residents and people who frequent these commercial buildings get to benefit from the convenience of having two accessible MRT stations.\nUpon looking at the area on Google Street Maps, some buildings may also be hotels. Building an MRT station in the catchment area would ensure that Singaporeans and tourists staying within this area will be better served by public transportation, especially since there are no nearby other MRT stations within this area, apart from Founder’s Memorial.\nSports Hub also lies within the 1000m buffer zone. While it may be a 1000m walk from TE23, people who visit the Sports Hub are most likely to be ready to engage in some form of exercise. Hence, the willingness to walk 1000m to their destination will likely be greater than 15%. Thus, TE23 will serve as a sustainable and motivational form of transportation for active citizens travelling to the Sports Hub. Hence, Singapore residents who wish to exercise will be able to use public transportation to travel there.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCycling Catchment and Buffer\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the cycling catchment area, more amenities are covered. The map shows more types of services that Singaporeans can access at the convenience of cycling. Within this area, a school - specifically Dunman High - is accessible within a 1500m distance of the MRT stations. This enables more efficient travel for the students attending that school and eases traffic in the area during school drop-off and pick-up.\nThis area also now extends to the Paddock Club F1 area through the Benjamin Sheares Bridge, similar to TE22A.\n\n\nTE24 – Katong Park\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWalking Catchment and Buffer\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the walking catchment area, it covers a significant number of residential areas for both low rise and high rise buildings, including hotels. The station will, thus, be able to cater to a large and diverse set of people who may need to travel to tourist attractions or to commercial buildings. Since the station aims to reduce travel time to the central area, both tourists and workers will be better accommodated.\nDunman High is also 400-600m away (5-7 minutes’ walk) from TE24, making it more convenient for students to alight here than at Mountbatten, the current nearest MRT which is a 15 minutes’ walk.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCycling Catchment and Buffer\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the cycling catchment area, more amenities are covered and other schools - Tanjong Katong Girl’s School and Tanjong Katong Secondary School - also lie within this area. Should students opt for cycling, this station has the potential to ease traffic during drop-off and pick-up periods, which will likely be similar across all levels, especially in primary school.\nA large number of low rise residential areas are also covered within this region. This could mean that a significant number of people will no longer need to use their cars to get to different areas of Singapore.\n\n\nTE25 – Tanjong Katong\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWalking Catchment and Buffer\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile there is a discrepancy between the buffer area and the area covered by the network, the difference is mostly in the water, suggesting that this area is well connected by the roads and other networks.\nThe walking catchment area covers a significant number of residential areas - both high rise and low rise, including hotels and condominiums. This could suggest that the MRT line would need to be able to accommodate a diverse pool of needs, ranging from tourists and workers alike. Importantly, the majority of them are low rise residential areas, where people are generally car owners. Making public transport more accessible to these residents could incentivise them to use their cars less frequently and opt to use the train when travelling.\nA large number of amenities lie within this area, such as cafes and shops.  Building an MRT station in this area could boost business due to increased footfall and more efficient travel.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCycling Catchment and Buffer\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the cycling catchment area, even more amenities are covered. The map shows more types of services that Singaporeans can access at the convenience of cycling. We can easily see that most buildings, which are mainly residential, lie within the range of 1600m.\nCyclists will be able to visit various amenities throughout this region, which could boost interest in smaller businesses within this area. Furthermore, several schools lie within this catchment area. In doing so, families beyond only the Tanjong Katong region will be served and students will have alternative means to go to school. This could reduce traffic in the region, particularly during drop-off and pick-up periods.\n\n\n\nTE26 – Marine Parade\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCatchment Area\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuffer\n\n\n\n\n\nTE26 will have 6 exits that are distributed throughout a relatively large area, where 3 of them lie outside the MRT station itself. The MRT will be located directly beside a few large retail buildings, with one of its exits lying inside one retail building to provide easy access to the station through the mall. This suggests that the intended main beneficiaries of such a station would be people who work in the commercial buildings within the region.\nDespite this, within the 0-400m contour of the Iso-Area, it is mostly residential and retail buildings. This shows that the MRT station will be useful in encouraging a diverse set of people to take public transportation as it can reach out to a large number of people who have a high willingness to walk to an MRT station to travel.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCatchment Area\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuffer\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the cycling ISO-area, we see that there are mostly more residential and low rise residentials covered by approximately 500 and 1500 respectively, suggesting that people who can cycle to this MRT station are mostly residents as well. Of particular interest is the high number of low rise residentials - many of whom are car owners. This could encourage them to switch away from driving and to more sustainable forms of transport.\nSince TE26 reaches approximately 4300 residential, low rise residential and commercial buildings, the largest out of all the other stage 4 TEL MRT stations, the presence of 6 exits to provide greater convenience is justifiable.\n\n\nTE27 – Marine Terrace\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCatchment Area\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuffer\n\n\n\n\n\nThe contours cover relatively the same areas as the buffer zones, suggesting that the road network in this catchment area is near ideal.\nTE27 will have 6 exits distributed evenly on both sides of Marine Parade road and will be located within 0-400m of 5 institutions. This MRT will hence provide students more options and convenience to travel. It could also substantially reduce traffic congestion, especially during drop-off periods, as students may opt to use the MRT instead of private vehicles.\nAdditionally, many residential and low rise residential buildings are located within 0-600m of the MRT station, meaning that there will be a high percentage of people who will walk to the MRT despite a 50% willingness at a distance of 600m.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCatchment Area\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuffer\n\n\n\n\n\nFurther away, the Iso-Area reaches more low rise residential buildings. In addition to people living within 1km of TE27, those who are willing to cycle to the MRT station will include those that stay in landed properties.\nWith many amenities that are of high importance and have large density usage, this shows that TE27 will be a very useful station for people to easily access public transportation, hence encouraging more use of public transportation.\n\n\n\nTE28 – Siglap\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCatchment Area\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuffer\n\n\n\n\n\nMost of the buildings within the walking ISO-area of TE28 are low rise residential, suggesting that most people living in this area are of high economic status. As such, most may own private vehicles and the presence of an MRT may not be as effective to encourage people to use public transportation as their form of travel. However, it still has the potential to encourage them to switch over to public transportation occasionally and its presence can precipitate a modal shift within this population.\nThere are also residential buildings within 0-400m of the MRT and this MRT may greatly serve these residents. Additionally, Victoria School is located within 200m of the MRT, providing great convenience for these students as well.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCatchment Area\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuffer\n\n\n\n\n\nWith a larger Iso-Area, the catchment area reaches other forms of building types such as warehouses in the North of this catchment area. Hence, workers may benefit from this MRT as they are able to easily travel to work by cycling from the MRT since it is a manageable distance from the MRT station.\nComparing the buffers to the contours for both Cycling and Walking, the contours cover almost the entire area of the buffers, suggesting that the road network is very near ideal as the distance from a building or POI to the MRT station is equally distant at every interval level.\n\n\nTE29 – Bayshore\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCatchment Area\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuffer\n\n\n\n\n\nAll types of residential buildings lie close on the north and west sides of TE29. Interestingly, an equal number of residential and low rise residential buildings fall within 0-600m of the catchment area. However, there are no buildings or points of interest that are near these two exits as well. This suggests that the main intended beneficiaries of this station would be residents of all socioeconomic classes but not businesses or tourists. The inclusion of the higher socioeconomic classes means that the wealthier residents may be encouraged to use private transport less and instead use public transport.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCatchment Area\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuffer\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the cycling catchment area, more amenities are covered. The map shows more types of services that Singaporeans can access at the convenience of cycling. More housing estates, as well as schools can be reached. These institutions lie within 1-1.2km of the MRT, a less than 10 minutes cycle. Hence, this convenience may encourage students to cycle to school from the MRT.\n\n\nConclusion\nThe catchment areas, for both walking and cycling, show us that the main beneficiaries of  the TEL Stage 4 MRT stations are the residents. This is primarily due to the large catering of land use by the Master Plan 2019 toward Residential along the East Coast of Singapore in the Marine Parade Subzone. These Residential land use will hence have the greatest direct impact by the presence of TEL. With the majority of these residential buildings being low rise residential estates, the TEL may achieve its goal of encouraging more people to switch to more sustainable forms of transportation as residents will have high convenience and accessibility levels to use public transport to travel to the city centre (as compared to now where they are left with little choice but to use their private vehicles). Since walking or cycling to these MRT stations is very convenient for these residents, and using public transportation to get to the city centre is much more affordable than using taxis or paying city centre parking fees, a majority of these residents will definitely switch to using TEL for the journeys. This will improve road congestion problems"

This percentage does not reflect the number of Singaporeans who is willing to take public transportation but reflects the number of Singaporeans willing to walk to MRT station.\n\n\n\n8.2 Catchment Population Distribution (Cycling)\n\n\n\n\n\nBased on the Cycling Catchment Population Distribution for TE28 Siglap, we can see that the largest proportion of the catchment population falls within Frankel. This is shown by the darkest red contour layers. The largest subzone covered in this catchment area is also Frankel. This is shown by the largest contour covering Frankel. \nWe further broke down the population distribution per contour and subzone level below to visualize these numbers more clearly. Though these numbers are very large, the percentage of people who cycle is very low. As a result, these numbers do not reflect people who are willing to cycle to MRT but the distribution of catchment population within subzone areas.\nBased on the layout and numbers generated, these following subzones [Siglap (90.0%), Frankel (50.4%), Bayshore (24.5%), Bedok South (16.8%), Marine Parade (7.0%) and East Coast (0.5%)] are captured at the 1600m mark. Additionally, it is noted that:\n\n0.5% of East Coast falls within the catchment area\n\nAs a result, this subzone is considered insignificant, thus we will eliminate it from the list of subzones.\nTherefore, TE28 Siglap is accessible from multiple subzones by cycling:\n\nSiglap (90.0%)\nFrankel (50.4%)\nBayshore (24.5%)\nBedok South (16.8%)\nMarine Parade (7.0%)"

However, we can see that the largest proportion of catchment population falls within Bedok South. This is shown by the darkest blue contour layer.\nWe further broke down the population distribution per contour and subzone level below to visualize these numbers more clearly. Additionally, we will be multiplying these numbers at every contour level by a ratio (as mentioned earlier) to accurately reflect how many people who are willing to walk to TE29 Bayshore (shown below). \nBased on the numbers generated, the following breakdown are the Singaporeans who are willing to walk to TE29 Bayshore based on each contour interval:\n\n317 Singaporeans within 200m contour\n957 Singaporeans within 200-400m contour\n1013 Singaporeans within 400-600m contour\n1164 Singaporeans within 600-800m contour\n838 Singaporeans within 800-1000m contour\n\n13004 Singaporeans stay within the 1000m contour but only 4289 of them are willing to walk to TE29 Bayshore. The percentage of catchment population who is willing to walk to MRT Station over catchment population is 33.0%. This percentage does not reflect the number of Singaporeans who is willing to take public transportation but reflects the number of Singaporeans willing to walk to MRT station.\n\n\n\n9.2 Catchment Population Distribution (Cycling)\n\n\n\n\n\nBased on the Cycling Catchment Population Distribution for TE29 Bayshore, we can see that the largest proportion of the catchment population falls within Bedok South.
